# [289. Game of Life]()

### Notes

**Matrix - Simulation**

- Key: \
the evaluation should be applied to the WHOLE matrix at the same time.\
--> this means we cannot update the board while misleading the following updates.

**Shallow & Deep Copy - List**
- Deep copy:\
  `list = original_list[:]`\
  `list = original_list.copy()`

- Shallow copy:\
  `list = original_list`

- If copy list of list:\
  deep copy at each list level.\
  e.g.: here we can use `[pair[:] for pair in board]`, BUT NOT `[pair for pair in board]` (no deep copy at pair level).

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  use extra space - duplicate original board to avoid board keeps updated and cause following updates to be wrong.\
  TC: O(r*c), TC: O(r*c).
```python
class Solution:
    def gameOfLife(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        r, c = len(board), len(board[0])
        # l, r, u, d, dia_ul, dia_ur, dia_dl, dia_dr
        neighbors = [(0,-1), (0,1), (-1,0), (1,0), (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)]
        board_copy = [pair[:] for pair in board]  # or: [[board[row][col] for col in range(c)] for row in range(r)] 

        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                live_neighbors = 0
                for x,y in neighbors:
                    if i+x >= 0 and i+x < r and j+y >= 0 and j+y < c and board_copy[i+x][j+y] == 1:
                        live_neighbors += 1
                if board_copy[i][j] == 1 and (live_neighbors < 2 or live_neighbors > 3):
                    board[i][j] = 0
                elif board_copy[i][j] == 0 and live_neighbors == 3:
                    board[i][j] = 1
```

- Method 2:\
  No extra space used. Use other symbols to represent updated cell, so no misleading in the following steps.\
  TC: O(r*c) -> iterate matrix twice, SC: O(1).
```python
class Solution:
    def gameOfLife(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        r, c = len(board), len(board[0])
        # l, r, u, d, dia_ul, dia_ur, dia_dl, dia_dr
        neighbors = [(0,-1), (0,1), (-1,0), (1,0), (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)]

        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                live_neighbors = 0
                for x,y in neighbors:
                    if i+x >= 0 and i+x < r and j+y >= 0 and j+y < c and (board[i+x][j+y] == 1 or board[i+x][j+y] == -1):
                        live_neighbors += 1
                if board[i][j] == 1 and (live_neighbors < 2 or live_neighbors > 3):
                    board[i][j] = -1
                elif board[i][j] == 0 and live_neighbors == 3:
                    board[i][j] = 2

        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                if board[i][j] == -1:
                    board[i][j] = 0
                elif board[i][j] == 2:
                    board[i][j] = 1
```
