# [994. Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

Medium

### Solutions
- Method 1:\
  BFS.

  Idea:
  - since rotten can be any where (not necessary `(0,0)`), and only rotten can spread. So we need to first make all rotten in queue
    and calculate all fresh. Then doing BFS.
  - Steps: 1. Get all rotten in `q`. 2.Iterate and compute minutes (in each level of rotten, increase 1 minute).
  - If finally fresh is decreased to exact 0, then return minutes. Otherwise, impossible, return -1.

  Edge cases:\
  add minutes for each rotten level only.\
  1st-level rotten has minute=0.\
  only rotten in grid or no orange in grid should be 0.
  - `[[0]]`: return 0
  - `[[1]]`: return -1
  - `[[0, 2]]`: return 0

  TC: O(m*n), SC: O(m*n) - there can be all rotten in grid

```python
class Solution:
    def orangesRotting(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        directions = [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        q = collections.deque()
        fresh = 0
        minutes = -1

        # 1. Get all rotten in q
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 2:
                    q.append((i,j))
                elif grid[i][j] == 1:
                    fresh += 1

        q.append((-1,-1))

        # 2. Iterate and compute minutes
        while q:
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                curr_r, curr_c = q.popleft()
                # In each level of rotten, increase 1 minute.
                if curr_r == -1:
                    minutes += 1
                    if q:
                        q.append((-1,-1))
                else:
                    for r, c in directions:
                        if 0 <= curr_r + r < m and 0 <= curr_c + c < n \
                            and grid[curr_r+r][curr_c+c] == 1:
                            q.append((curr_r+r, curr_c+c))
                            fresh -= 1
                            grid[curr_r+r][curr_c+c] = 2
                
        return minutes if fresh == 0 else -1
