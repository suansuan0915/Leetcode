# [1768. Merge Strings Alternately](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/description/)

Easy

### Notes

- string doesn't have `append()` attribute.\
  can only be `+`.

- `list[idx]` with index out of range will raise error, CANNOT be evaluated with `None`.

### Solutions

- Method:\
  Two pointers.\
  TC: O(m+n), SC: O(1)
```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        p1, p2 = 0, 0
        m, n = len(word1), len(word2)
        res = ''

        while p1 < min(m, n) and p2 < min(m, n):
            if word1[p1]:
                res += word1[p1]
                p1 += 1
            if word2[p2]:
                res += word2[p2]
                p2 += 1
        
        res += word2[p2:] if p1 >= len(word1) else word1[p1:]

        return res
```
