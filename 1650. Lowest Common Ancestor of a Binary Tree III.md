Similar Q:\
Q236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree\
Q160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

### Solutions
- Method 1:\
  Iteration w/ extra space.

  Difference w/ Q236:
  - nodes have `node.parent` property, and the input don't have root. So we don't need to iterate and find parents for all nodes.
  
  TC: O(n), SC: O(n)
  
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.parent = None
"""

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, p: 'Node', q: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        # queue = [root]
        # parents = {root: None}

        # while queue:
        #     for _ in range(len(queue)):
        #         curr = queue.pop()
        #         if curr.left:
        #             parents[curr.left] = curr
        #             queue.append(curr.left)
        #         if curr.right:
        #             parents[curr.right] = curr
        #             queue.append(curr.right)
        
        p_ancestors = set()
        while p:
            p_ancestors.add(p)
            p = p.parent

        while q not in p_ancestors:
            q = q.parent
        return q
```

- Method 2:\
  Iteration w/ no extra space:\
  Similar to `Q160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists`.

  TC: O(n), SC: O(1)

```python

```
