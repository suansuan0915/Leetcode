# [71. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Medium

### Notes

`string.split(separator, maxsplit)`

- As the problem states:\
  <img width="486" alt="image" src="https://github.com/suansuan0915/Leetcode/assets/51430523/373d6a19-9b9e-4ee0-8c70-0ba7df2e1cf3">\
  We move the step from left to right in the path: like `'/a//./b/../../c'`, we go from a to b then go up two levels, which means we come back to b and then to a and finally stop on c.

  Therefore, it means:
  - when meet `.` or ` `, we do nothing but stay where we are.
  - When meet any `'..'`, we remove the character before it. If there's no character before it, just skip.
    
  This is ceherent to **stack** method.

- Edge case:\
  when `..` is at root level, instead of in middle of path: \
  `'/a/../.././../'`\
  `/../`

  ### Solutions

  - Method:\
    Stack.
    
    TC: O(n)\
    SC: O(n) -> O(2n): stack and splitted list
```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        elements = path.split('/')
        lst = []

        for ele in elements:
            if ele in ('', '.'):
                continue
            if ele == '..':
                if lst:
                    lst.pop()
                else: 
                    continue
            else:
                lst.append(ele)

        ans = '/' + '/'.join(lst)

        return ans
```
