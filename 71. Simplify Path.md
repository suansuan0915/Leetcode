### Notes

- As the problem states:\
  <img width="486" alt="image" src="https://github.com/suansuan0915/Leetcode/assets/51430523/373d6a19-9b9e-4ee0-8c70-0ba7df2e1cf3">\
  We move the step from left to right in the path: like `'/a//./b/../../c'`, we go from a to b then go up two levels, which means we come back to b and then to a and finally stop on c.

  Therefore, it means:
  - when meet `.` or ` `, we do nothing but stay where we are.
  - When meet any `'..'`, we remove the character before it. If there's no character before it, just skip.
    
  This is ceherent to **stack** method.

- Edge case:\
  `'/a/../.././../'`

  ### Solutions

  - Method:\
    Stack.\
    TC: O(n)\
    SC: O(n) -> O(2n): stack and splitted list
```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        stack = []

        for char in path.split('/'):
            if not char or char == '.':
                continue
            elif char == '..':
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(char)

        res = '/' + '/'.join(stack)
        return res
```
