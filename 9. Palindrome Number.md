# [9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/)

Easy

### Notes

Avoid convert number into string:\
-> build a reversed number of x.

How to build a reversed number?
- get modulus of x.
- build reversed number from end to start up until current digit.
- prepare for # for next loop to get modulus.

### Solutions
- Method 1:\
  compare number to reversed number.\
  TC: O(d) - d is # of digits in x.\
  SC: O(1)
```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        reverse_x = 0
        temp = x

        if x < 0:
            return False

        while temp > 0:
            last_d = temp % 10 
            reverse_x = reverse_x * 10 + last_d
            temp //= 10
        
        return reverse_x == x
```
