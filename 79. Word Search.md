## Backtrack

### Solutions
Backtrack.

Idea:
- Backtrack: recursion.
- Loop through each cell in board as the starting point, then from the starting point, check 1-by-1.
- Base case:
  - if the length of `word` (`suffix`) into the next backtrack function is 0, means we complete finding the target, return True to upper level.
  - if the row or column index is out-of-range or the current cell != word[0], means this path is abandoned, return False to upper level.
- "Backtrack":
  not like other backtrack problems where we pop last element and go into another path,\
  we just return T/F here: if T, we get final answer; if F, go into next starting point in main function. 

Note:
- Reset each cell back to number, in case we need to find path starting from another cell in main function.
- "return" in recursion:\
  We need to "return" in base case **AND** the main function of the recursion.

L: length of the word.\
N: # of board cells.\
TC: O(N * 3^L)  -> why 3 instead of 4: becoz we don't explore the direction we came from.\
SC: O(N)

```python
class Solution:
    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
        self.rows = len(board)
        self.cols = len(board[0])
        self.board = board
        self.directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]

        for i in range(self.rows):
            for j in range(self.cols):
                if self.backtrack(i, j, word):
                    return True
        
        return False

    def backtrack(self, r, c, suffix):
        if len(suffix) == 0:
            return True

        if (r < 0 or r == self.rows \
            or c < 0 or c == self.cols  \
            or self.board[r][c] != suffix[0]):
            return False

        self.board[r][c] = '#'
        returned = False

        for ix, iy in self.directions:
            returned = self.backtrack(r + ix, c + iy, suffix[1:])
            if returned:
                break

        self.board[r][c] = suffix[0]

        return returned
