### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  BFS.

  Problem Statement Notes:
  ` return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.`
  - `segmented into a space-separated sequence`:\
    Whether any overlapping of letters in these words in `wordDict`, as long as any substring of `s` is in `wordDict`, return True.
  - `wordDict` can have mixed words of qualified or unqualified. As long as all qualified substrings are in words, return True.
  - Therefore, it's like finding if all substrings of `s` are in `wordDict`.
 
  Note:
  - boundary of `end`.
  
  Edge case:
  - `s = "a", wordDict = ["a"]`

  `n`: length of s. `m`: # of words in wordDict. `k`: average length of words in wordDict.
  TC: O(n**3 + mk), SC: O(n + mk)

```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        words = set(wordDict)
        visited_ends = set()
        q = deque([0])

        while q:
            start = q.popleft()

            if start == len(s):
                return True

            for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):
                if end in visited_ends:
                    continue
                elif s[start: end] in words:
                    q.append(end)
                    visited_ends.add(end)

        return False
```
