# [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Medium

### Notes

- Idea:\
  we want to find maximum length, so we need a start as head and an end as tail.\
  Make `num-1` in if statement, becoz we never know if a number is in consecutive sequence or not when we first see it. Only when check the number before it (if it's inside the set of nums) can we know if current number is inside a sequence but not as head or tail.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Hashmap.

  Note: \
  how to avoid TLE (which represents by nested loops here)
  - for loop: loop through set instead of nums
  - only checking whenever a head occurs.

  TC: O(n),\
  SC: O(n)
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        num_set = set(nums)
        ans = 0

        for num in num_set:
            start = num - 1
            if start not in num_set:
                end = num
                while end in num_set:
                    end += 1
                ans = max(ans, end - start - 1)

        return ans
```
