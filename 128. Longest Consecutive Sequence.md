# [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Medium

### Notes

Make `start-1` in if statement, becoz we never know if a number is in consecutive sequence or not when we first see it. Only when check the # before it can we know if current # is in a sequence.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Hashmap.\
  TC: O(n)\
  SC: O(n)
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums_set = set(nums)
        length = 0

        for start in nums:
            if start - 1 not in nums_set:
                end = start + 1
                while end in nums_set:
                    end += 1
                length = max(length, end-start)

        return length
```
