# [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Medium

### Notes

- Idea:\
  we want to find maximum length, so we need a start as head and an end as tail.\
  Make `num-1` in if statement, becoz we never know if a number is in consecutive sequence or not when we first see it. Only when check the number before it (if it's inside the set of nums) can we know if current number is inside a sequence but not as head or tail.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Hashmap.\
  TC: O(n)\
  SC: O(n)
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums_set = set(nums)
        length = 0

        for num in nums:
            start = num - 1
            if start not in nums_set: # num is possibly a head
                # check if a real head
                end = num + 1
                while end in nums_set:
                    end += 1
                length = max(length, end-num)

        return length
```
