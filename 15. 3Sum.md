### Notes

Similar to [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/), [167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150).

Except that 2Sum assumes non-sorted array and only and must 1 solution exists, 2Sum II assumes array is sorted and only and must 1 solution exists.

- `set()`\
  doesn't have `.aapend()` method, can only `.add(tuple())` -> inside the tuple, there is ONLY one object.

- `sorted(list)`: return a new list.\
  `list.sort()`: sort in-place.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Two pointers + set.\
  Decompose the problem into one pointer + 2Sum problem:\
  First, sort the array.  -> so problem can be solved similar to sorted 2Sum.\
  Then, pointer i moves towards right from 1st index, while pointer j moves towards right from i+1, and pointer k moves to left from end of the array.

  TC: O(n**2)\
  SC: O(n) - input and output are not considered in SC, so here only consider sorting result.
```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = set()
        nums.sort()

        for i in range(len(nums)-2):
            target = 0 - nums[i]
            j = i + 1
            k = len(nums) - 1
            while j < k:
                if nums[j] + nums[k] == target:
                    res.add(tuple([nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]))
                    j += 1
                    k -= 1
                elif nums[j] + nums[k] < target:
                    j += 1
                elif nums[j] + nums[k] > target:
                    k -= 1
            
        return res
```
