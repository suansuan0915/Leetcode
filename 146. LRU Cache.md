### Notes
See [Editorial](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/editorial/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150).

- Why double-linkedlist?\
  `key-value pair`: hashmap.\
  `get() in O(1)`:
  - array/list cannot do search in O(1), but hashmap can.
  - `get()` action include: return -1; OR return value, then relocate this key to back of the queue (becoz this node has been used recently).
  `put() in O(1)`: 
  - this action consists of 3 sub-actions: update + remove + add, each should be O(1).
  - In details:
    - If key is already in dic: remove the node (add later).
    - If key is not in dic: initiate a node w/ key-value, add the node into dic (add later).
    - Then, add the node.
    - Next, check if capacity exceeds:
      - if exceed: remove least recently used node (remove head.next), repoint, delete the key in dic.
      - if not: return
  - `update`: hashmap.
  - `remove`, `add` w/ least/most recently used key: we can do this two action at two ends of a queue.
    In order to complete in O(1), we think of linkedlist,
    where removal or add of one node at any location can be done in O(1).

  Therefore, 
  - hashmap: to store key-value pairs. Here value is node.
  - Double-linkedlist: since we need to *remove at head* or *add a node at tail* side in a linkedlist, implying we need to keep track of
    the *prev* and *next* of the specific node (linked to the specific key).

- Edge case:\
  When there's empty LRU cache.\
  when add a node, it acts as head and tail (when capacity=1 and we need to delete the least recently used node, there's no head or tail
  (newly-added node acts as head and tail after added)).\
  -> therefore, use two dummy nodes as head and tail nodes.
  

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Double linkedlist.\
  First, define a double linkedlist in a separate class.\
  Then, in main class, define attributes:
  - capacity
  - a hashmap
  - two dummy nodes: head and tail.
  - point head to tail AND tail to head ("double" linkedlist)\
  
  Next, define `remove()`, `add()` methods.

  Note:
  - for hashmap: store key-value pairs as `key: node` will be more efficient for a linkedlist.
  - define another class for listnode and ONLY for the node itself! for `head` and `tail`, define them in main LRUCache class.

  TC: O(1), SC: O(capacity)
  
```python
class doubleLinkedlist:

    def __init__(self, key, val):
        self.key = key
        self.val = val
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None
        # self.head = -1
        # self.tail = -1
        # self.head.next = self.tail
        # self.tail.prev = self.head

class LRUCache:

    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.hm = collections.defaultdict()
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.head = doubleLinkedlist(-1, -1)
        self.tail = doubleLinkedlist(-1, -1)
        self.head.next = self.tail
        self.tail.prev = self.head

    def remove(self, key):
        node = self.hm[key]
        prev_node = node.prev
        next_node = node.next
        prev_node.next = next_node
        next_node.prev = prev_node

    def add(self, key, node):
        tail_prev = self.tail.prev
        tail_prev.next = node
        node.prev = tail_prev
        node.next = self.tail
        self.tail.prev = node

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key in self.hm:
            self.remove(key)
            self.add(key, self.hm[key])
            return self.hm[key].val
        return -1

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        if key in self.hm:
            self.remove(key)
        elif len(self.hm) >= self.capacity:
            to_remove = self.head.next
            self.remove(to_remove.key)
            del self.hm[to_remove.key]
        to_add = doubleLinkedlist(key, value)
        self.add(key, to_add)
        self.hm[key] = to_add


# Your LRUCache object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = LRUCache(capacity)
# param_1 = obj.get(key)
# obj.put(key,value)
```
