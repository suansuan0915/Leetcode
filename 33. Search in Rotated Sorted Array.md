### Notes

- Method 1: Find pivot + Binary search\
  First, find **pivot** (which is smaller than numbers right to it, including the last index number. While all numbers left to pivot is larger than pivot and even all numbers to its right).
  - how to find "pivot"?\
    since "pivot" will be the leftmost (the smallest number) to the right of nums[-1], we use `nums[-1]` as benchmark in binary search to find it.
    
  Then, after finding pivot index, we split the array into two sections, then **on each section** do **binary search**:
  - If target is larger than number at len(nums)-1, then binary search boundary is nums[0: pivot-1].
  - If target is smaller than number at len(nums)-1, then binary search boundary is nums[pivot: len(nums)-1].
- Pay attention to *edge case*, like `[1]`, `[5,1,3]`. This is key to while loop condition if includes `=` or not.

- Leetcode IDE would return error:\

  Reason:\
  we only run some "middle" step here to check the std out result (like `print(xxx)`), where we don't specify a "return". So by default it return None. This is not consistent with the return data type set by the testing. Therefore, type error is raised.

  SC: O(1)
```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        
        ## Get pivot index:
        l, r = 0, len(nums)-1

        while l <= r:
            mid = l + (r-l)//2
            if nums[mid] > nums[-1]:
                l = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] <= nums[-1]:
                r = mid - 1
           
        pivot_idx = l

        ## Get target index
        # get boundary
        if target == nums[-1]:
            return len(nums) - 1
        elif target < nums[-1]: # on right of pivot
            start, end = pivot_idx, len(nums)-1
        elif target > nums[-1]: # on left of pivot
            start, end = 0, pivot_idx - 1
        
        # search for target
        while start <= end:
            m = start + (end - start)//2
            if nums[m] == target:
                return m
            elif nums[m] < target:
                start = m + 1
            elif nums[m] > target:
                end = m - 1 
        return -1
```
