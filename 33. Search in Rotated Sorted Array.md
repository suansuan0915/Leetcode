### Notes

- Method 1: Find pivot + Binary search\
  First, find **pivot** (which is smaller than numbers right to it, including the last index number. While all numbers left to pivot is larger than pivot and even all numbers to its right).
  - how to find "pivot"?\
    since "pivot" will be the leftmost (the smallest number) to the right of nums[-1], we use `nums[-1]` as benchmark in binary search to find it.
    
  Then, after finding pivot index, we split the array into two sections, then **on each section** do **binary search**:
  - If target is larger than number at len(nums)-1, then binary search boundary is nums[0: pivot-1].
  - If target is smaller than number at len(nums)-1, then binary search boundary is nums[pivot: len(nums)-1].
- Pay attention to *edge case*, like `[1]`, `[5,1,3]`. This is key to while loop condition if includes `=` or not.

- Leetcode IDE would return error:\

  Reason:\
  we only run some "middle" step here to check the std out result (like `print(xxx)`), where we don't specify a "return". So by default it return None. This is not consistent with the return data type set by the testing. Therefore, type error is raised.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Find pivot + Binary Seach.

  Note:
  - After defining the exact search area, still search in `nums`, NOT the new search area. (becoz we need to return index in `nums`)

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        # 1. find inflection point
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while l < r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if nums[mid] > nums[-1]:
                l = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] < nums[-1]:
                r = mid  # if a number < nums[-1], itself may be the inflection point.

        bound = l

        # 2. find search area
        if target == nums[bound]:
            return bound
        elif target > nums[-1]:
            # search = nums[:bound]
            l, r = 0, bound - 1
        else:
            # search = nums[bound:]
            l, r = bound, len(nums) - 1

        # 3. search for target in nums, NOT only "new search area"
        # l, r = 0, len(search) - 1
        while l <= r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1

        return -1
