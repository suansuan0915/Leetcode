# [408. Valid Word Abbreviation](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-word-abbreviation/description/)

Easy

### Solutions

- Method:\
  Two pointers.\
  l, r both starts from the last index of the words, and go from right to left. -> So that we can compare if l, r both arrive at index 0 to return true.
  If starts from index 0 and go from left to right, since two strings have different length, it's not convenient to compare.
  - Edge Case:\
    `word=['a'], abbr=[2]`\
  - Mind m, n need to -1 because it's used as index to query the exact digit in the string (so has to be len(str)-1).\
    But i, j are the pointers moving in exact strings.\
    That is, if at the starting point: word[m-1], abbr[n-1], i=m, j=n.

    Better to dry run with exact examples.
```python
class Solution:
    def validWordAbbreviation(self, word: str, abbr: str) -> bool:
        i, j = len(word), len(abbr)
        t = 1
        prev_num = None

        while i > 0 and j > 0:
            w, a = i-1, j-1
            if word[w] == abbr[a]:
                i -= 1
                j -= 1
                t = 1
                if prev_num == 0:
                    return False 
            elif abbr[a].isnumeric():
                prev_num = int(abbr[a])
                i -= int(abbr[a]) * t
                j -= 1
                t *= 10          
            else:
                return False
        
        return i == j == 0
```
