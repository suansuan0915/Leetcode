## 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

:alarm_clock: Jan 29

### LinkedList Traversal

Normally, linkedlist is traversed one node by another from head node.\
We can get length by O(1) as array, since linkedlist is given by the head node and traverse order. \
So, O(N) is needed to find linkedlist's length.

To find the kth node from end to beginning, we need to use trick to get optimal TC in one traversal O(N).
