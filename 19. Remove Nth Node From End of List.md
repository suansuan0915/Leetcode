## 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

:alarm_clock: Oct 3

### LinkedList Traversal

Normally, linkedlist is traversed one node by another from head node.\
We can get length by O(1) as array, since linkedlist is given by the head node and traverse order. \
So, O(N) is needed to find linkedlist's length.

To find the kth node from end to beginning, we need to use trick to get optimal TC in one traversal O(N).

*"Trick"*:\

##### Solutions:
- Method 1:
  - Two passes: record list length; reconnect pointers.
  - becoz the head may be removed and we need to return a linkedlist, we need a dummy prehead.
  - No need to set removed node's next pointer to None, becoz:\
    after we change prev.next to another node, the removed node is no longer referenced (since connection w/ prev node breaks). \
   garbage collection: once a node is no longer referenced by any other part of the program, it will be automatically cleaned up by the garbage collector. So need to manually reset its next pointer to None.
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prehead = ListNode(-1)
        prev = prehead
        prev.next = head

        ## 1st pass:
        curr = head
        length = 0

        while curr:
            length += 1
            curr = curr.next

        ## 2nd pass:
        removed_length = length - n
        # prehead.next = head
        # curr = head

        ### WRONG: becoz head (curr) can be removed.
        # idx = 0
        # while curr:
        #     if idx == removed_length-1:
        #         prev = curr
        #         removed_node = curr.next
        #         curr_next = removed_node.next
        #         prev.next = curr_next
        #         removed_node.next = None
        #         return prehead.next
        #     idx += 1
        #     curr = curr.next

        while removed_length > 0:
            removed_length -= 1
            prev = prev.next
        prev.next = prev.next.next

        return prehead.next
```

OR:
```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return []

        curr = head
        length = 0
        while curr:
            length += 1
            curr = curr.next

        order = length - n + 1
        curr = head
        dummy = ListNode(val=-1)
        prev = dummy
        prev.next = curr
        idx = 0
        while curr:
            idx += 1
            if idx == order:
                prev.next = curr.next
                break
            prev = curr
            curr = curr.next

        return dummy.next
```
  
- Method 2:\
While in use, use **dummy node** to avoid None node.
```python

def kNodefromEnd(head, k):
    p1 = head
    for i in range(k):
        p1 = p1.next
    p2 = head
    while p1:
        p1 = p1.next
        p2 = p2.next
    return p2

```

### LinkedList (traverse from end) + Two Pointers

- **Dummy node** in LinkedList\
Why?\
Avoid and deal with the occurance of any *Null node* pointer.\
For example, there are n nodes, and we want to delete nth node from end. In this case, we need to find (n+1)th node in our intuition, \
however, if no dummy, that would be a problem for us.

- How to initiate pointers?\
  Initiate a dummy node and make p1,p2 variables to equal to the node, instead of initiate two dummy nodes for p1,p2. \
  `dummy.next = head`, instead of p1 and p2.next = head.
  
- Which node to return?\
Cannot use head, e.g: [1], k=1\
return dummy.next, which indicates the beginning node (not necessary original "head")

In this Q, we need to find the node BEFORE nth node, which is (n-1)th node, and connect it with the node right AFTER nth node.\
`node(n-1) ----omit node(n)----> node(n+1)`

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        ## Method 1:
        # LinkedList (traverse from end) + Two Pointers
        # TC: O(N), SC: O(1)
        dummy = ListNode()
        dummy.next = head
        p1 = dummy
        for i in range(n):
            p1 = p1.next
        p2 = dummy
        while p1.next:
            p1 = p1.next
            p2 = p2.next
        #reconnect
        removed_node = p2.next
        p2.next = removed_node.next
        return dummy.next

        ## Method 2:
        # one pass traversal: two pointers

        # Better way to write code: 
        # Set a dummy node to connect w/ head, p1, p2 as pointers
        # Otherwise, p1, p2 as nodes here (not make sense)
        # p1, p2 = ListNode(), ListNode()
        # p1.next, p2.next = head, head
        dummy = ListNode()
        dummy.next = head
        p1, p2 = dummy, dummy
        i = 0

        while p1.next:
            if i >= n:
                p2 = p2.next

            i += 1
        
        p2.next = p2.next.next
