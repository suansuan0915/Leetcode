## 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

:alarm_clock: Jan 29

### LinkedList Traversal

Normally, linkedlist is traversed one node by another from head node.\
We can get length by O(1) as array, since linkedlist is given by the head node and traverse order. \
So, O(N) is needed to find linkedlist's length.

To find the kth node from end to beginning, we need to use trick to get optimal TC in one traversal O(N).

*"Trick"*:\

##### Template Code:
While in use, use **dummy node** to avoid None node.
```python

def kNodefromEnd(head, k):
    p1 = head
    for i in range(k):
        p1 = p1.next
    p2 = head
    while p1:
        p1 = p1.next
        p2 = p2.next
    return p2

```

### LinkedList (traverse from end) + Two Pointers

- **Dummy node** in LinkedList\
Why?\
Avoid and deal with the occurance of any *Null node* pointer.\
For example, there are n nodes, and we want to delete nth node from end. In this case, we need to find (n+1)th node in our intuition, \
however, if no dummy, that would be a problem for us.

- Which node to return?\
Cannot use head, e.g: [1], k=1\
return dummy.next, which indicates the beginning node (not necessary original "head")

In this Q, we need to find the node BEFORE nth node, which is (n-1)th node, and connect it with the node right AFTER nth node.\
`node(n-1) ----omit node(n)----> node(n+1)`

#### Code:
```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        ## Method 1:
        # LinkedList (traverse from end) + Two Pointers
        # TC: O(N), SC: O(1)
        dummy = ListNode()
        dummy.next = head
        p1 = dummy
        for i in range(n):
            p1 = p1.next
        p2 = dummy
        while p1.next:
            p1 = p1.next
            p2 = p2.next
        #reconnect
        removed_node = p2.next
        p2.next = removed_node.next
        return dummy.next

```
