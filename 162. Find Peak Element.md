# [162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Medium

### Notes

- Why "l<r":\
  Becoz when l, r are at same index (where mid=l=r), and if we are still in while loop, we cannot exit the loop since `if nums[mid]>=nums[mid+1]` condition.

- Why 'r=mid' instead of 'r=mid-1':\
  Becoz here we compare mid with mid+1, and the index we want to find is the one that larger than left and right neighbors.\
  Therefore, here we want to find mid or any index left to mid, instead of mid+1 (since `nums[mid]>nums[mid+1]`).\
  That's why we compress the right boundary to mid.

### Solution

- Method 1:\
  Binary Search.\
  TC: O(lgn)\
  SC: O(1)
```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums)-1
        while l < r:
            mid = l + (r-l)//2
            if nums[mid] >= nums[mid + 1]:
                r = mid 
            elif nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]:
                l = mid + 1
        return l
```
