# [162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Medium

### Notes

- Note: `peak` is a *local* peak, means any index when its value larger than its neighbor. The problem asks to return any local peak, not necessary a global peak.\
  --> so compare mid w/ neighbor, but not boundary.

- Why only need to compare index `i` w/ `i+1`, but not `i-1`?\
  **TL;DR**:\
  think of edge case (when only 2 elements, like `[1,3]`): mid-1 will cause index error.
  
  3 conditions:\
  compared to index [i+1], but not [i-1], becoz only when we *already knew* nums[i+1]>nums[i-1] can we move index to right side. \
  Starts from nums[0], it's a local peak only if nums[0]>nums[1], otherwise not peak and move forward; So next step, we only need to compare it with nums[2]. So on and so forth, only need to compare nums[i] w/ nums[i+1].
  - Strictly upward slope
  - Strictly downward slope
  - Peak with mixed slopes

- Why "l<r":\
  Becoz if `l<=r` and when `l==r` condition and there's only 1 element in search area ("only 1 element in search area" is the state we  will finally meet to decide the target answer for EVERY problem), nums[mid+1] not valid (index out of range). So use `l<r` to avoid error.

- Why `r=mid`:\
  because when `nums[mid]<nums[mid+1]` (now we go with right side of mid), left number can never be a peak, becoz it's smaller than it right number (on mid+1 position) now.\
  but when `nums[mid]>nums[mid+1]` (now we go with left side of mid), we already know mid number is larger that mid+1 number, it's possible it's also larger that mid-1 number, so we need to keep it.
  
- Fpr BS method: keep compress mid, BUT NOT l or r (this is Binary Search!!!), following the upward direction.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Binary Search.\
  TC: O(lgn), SC: O(1)
```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums)-1
        while l < r:
            mid = l + (r-l)//2
            if nums[mid] >= nums[mid + 1]:
                r = mid
            elif nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]:
                l = mid + 1
        return l
```

- Method 2:\
  Linear search.\
  Note: `peak` is a *local* peak, means any index when its value larger than its neighbor. The problem asks to return any local peak, not necessary a global peak.\

  compared to index [i+1], but not [i-1], becoz only when we *already knew* nums[i+1]>nums[i-1] can we move index to right side. \

  TC: O(n), SC: O(1)
```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:
                return i
            
        return len(nums)-1
```
