# [162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Medium

### Notes

- Why "l<r":\
  Becoz if `l<=r` and when `l==r` condition and there's only 1 element in seearch area ("only 1 element in search area" is the state we  will finally meet to decide the target answer for EVERY problem), nums[mid+1] not valid (index out of range). So use `l<r` to avoid error.

- keep compress l or r, following the upward direction.

### Solution

- Method 1:\
  Binary Search.\
  TC: O(lgn)\
  SC: O(1)
```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums)-1

        while l < r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if nums[mid] < nums[mid+1]:
                l += 1
            elif nums[mid] >= nums[mid+1]:
                r -= 1
            
        return l
```
