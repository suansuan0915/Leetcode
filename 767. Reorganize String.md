# [767. Reorganize String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/description/?envType=company&envId=amazon&favoriteSlug=amazon-three-months)

Medium

## cannot add +/- before values from unpacking sets. do it when do following assigning.

## Functions
1. `collections.Counter(iterable)`: return special object.
    - to access key-value pairs: Counter(iterable).items()
    - Counter(iterable).keys(), Counter(iterable).values()
2. `heapq.heapify(iterable)`:  modify the iterable **in-place**!\
    `heapq.heappop(heap_item)`  /  `heappush(heap_item, pushed_item)`

### Solutions

- Idea: \
   consume most frequent char as much as possible, except when prev char is the same (now choose next most frequent char)\
   ---> think of heap/priority queue (always min pop and min first --> use - to get "max heap")
   - only add back `-value+1` to heap if it's not 0.
   - Note: if we need char_2nd, first check if pq is None or not.
- Note:\
  cannot add +/- before values from unpacking sets. do it when do following assigning.
  -> WRONG: `-v, k = heappop(pq)`
- `n`: the length of s (the # of all chars). \
  `k`: the # of unique chars. (k<=26)\
  TC: O(n) -> O(nlgk), k is constant <= 26.\
  SC: O(1) -> O(k), k <= 26.

```python
class Solution:
    def reorganizeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        ans = []
        pq = [(-v, k) for k, v in Counter(s).items()]
        heapify(pq)

        for i in range(len(s)):
            v, k = heappop(pq)
            first_counts, first_char = -v, k
            if not ans or ans[-1] != first_char:
                ans.append(k)
                first_counts -= 1
                if first_counts > 0:
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (-first_counts, first_char))
            elif ans and ans[-1] == first_char:
                if not pq:
                    return ''
                v_2, k_2 = heappop(pq)
                second_counts, second_char = -v_2, k_2
                ans.append(k_2)
                second_counts -= 1
                if second_counts > 0:
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (-second_counts, second_char))
                heapq.heappush(pq, (-first_counts, first_char))

        return ''.join(ans)
```
