# [101.Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Easy

### Solutions:
- Method 1:\
  BFS iteration.\
  Note: include None nodes in q. Otherwise, error (example: `[1,2,2,3,null,3,null]`).
  
  "mirror": 
  - root are same.
  - reflection of subtrees: left==right, right==left (this is why compare left node w/ right node of two subtrees)\

  steps: 
  - check if roots are null (if null, continue, don't add new child nodes to q which can raise error, go to next nodes in q).
  - check if either is null:  if so, return False.
  - check: same value of cur nodes? if so, add child nodes in q for next comparison.
 
  Note:
  - Don't need for loop.
  - the order of if statements:\
    cannot swtch two "not None" statements.
  - TC is O(n) but not 2n:\
  although we include root twice at the beginning, 2nd root is a "dummy" with same value as root, means it's left/right nodes are None.\
  so q won't contain duplicate nodes twice in a level in following steps. So TC stays O(n) instead of O(2n).
    
  TC: O(n), SC: O(n)
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        q = collections.deque([root, root])

        while q:
            # WRONG: for _ in range(len(dq)):
            cur1 = q.popleft()  # or: use list and pop(0)
            cur2 = q.popleft()  # or: use list and pop(0)
            if cur1 is None and cur2 is None:
                continue # don't add child nodes, will raise error
            if cur1 is None or cur2 is None:
                return False
            if cur1.val != cur2.val:
                return False
            q.append(cur1.left)
            q.append(cur2.right)
            q.append(cur2.left)
            q.append(cur1.right)
        
        return True
```

- Method 2:\
  DFS recursion.
  
  Note: 
  - cannot add value comparison as base case of isMirror(), becoz if we directly compare node values here, risk is we would miss exploring children nodes.\
    For example, `[1,2,2,null,3,null,3]`.\
    exploration will stop at node 2 and 2 (root.left, root.right).
  - must meet all 3 requirements (3 requirements must be ALL True), CANNOT do `return eq1 == eq2 == (root1.val == root2.val)`.
  
  same TC, SC as method 1.
  
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        ## Method 2:
        # DFS
        return self.isMirror(root, root)

    def isMirror(self, root1, root2):
        if root1 is None and root2 is None:
            return True
        if root1 is None or root2 is None:
            return False
        # WRONG:
        # if l.val != r.val:
        #     return False
        # if l.val == r.val:
        #     return True
        
        return (
            (root1.val == root2.val)
            and self.isMirror(root1.left, root2.right) 
            and self.isMirror(root1.right, root2.left)
        )
```
