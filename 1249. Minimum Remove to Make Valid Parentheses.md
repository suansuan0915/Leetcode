### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  stack in 2 passes.\
  same idea as #20: remove leading ), keep correct pairs, finally removed extra (.

  - use `for idx, ele in enumerate(s)` to replace `for i in range(len(s))`.
  - `set.add(s)` vs `set.update(multiple_s)`:
     - if s or multiple_s is an iterable, it should be converted to set object.
     - return new set vs. update set in-place and return None
  - `set1.union(set2, set3, ...)`: TC is O(sum of sets' length)
  
  Note: \
  be careful not to make O(n) inside loop here. so use append and set (instead of add and list).
  
```python
class Solution:
    def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        removed = set()
        ans = []

        # for i in range(len(s)):
        for i, ele in enumerate(s):
            if ele == '(':
                stack.append(i)
            elif ele == ')' and stack:
                stack.pop()
            elif ele == ')' and not stack:
                removed.add(i)

        # if stack:
        #     removed.update(tuple(stack))  # cannot use set.add() here
        removed = removed.union(set(stack))

        # for j in range(len(s)):
        for j, ele in enumerate(s):
            if j not in removed:
                ans.append(ele)

        return ''.join(ans) 
```

- Method 2:\
  other shortened stack w/ 2 passes.
