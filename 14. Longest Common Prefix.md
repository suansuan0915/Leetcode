# [14. Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/description/)

Easy

### Notes

Here, "prefix" means the digits from index 0 to index i.\
If: `["flower", "flour", "reflow"]`, return "".

So, vertical scanning by character on each index in each word is easy to handle.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Vertival scanning.\
  if given `strs=[]`, it means it's not none, just has empty value. Same apply to `""`, `" "`. Only `str = None` evaluated to be None.\
  TC: O(n*d)\
  SC: O(d)
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        if len(strs) == 0:
            return ""
        
        base_word = strs[0]

        for i in range(len(base_word)):
            for word in strs[1:]:
                if i >= len(word) or base_word[i] != word[i]:
                    return base_word[0:i]
        
        return base_word
```
