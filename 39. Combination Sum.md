## Backtrack

### Solutions
Idea: recursion.
- base case: 
  - If taget == 0: append to ans and return. 
  - If taget < 0: return.
- how to evolve: find each number by index and reduce target accordingly to check if target can reduced to 0.
- "Backtrack": if meets, pop and return to upper level.

Note:
- Avoid duplicate lists: like [2,3] and [3,2]. Restrict next list should only start w/ # from the prev index and indexes after prev idx.
- don't put `target -= candidates[i]` as a separate line, put it into the inner backtrack function. Otherwise, if a target<0 base case returns, the upper function's target has changed, this is incorrect.

Note: changing list adding.

```python
class Solution:
    def backtrack(self, candidates, target, idx, path, ans):
        if target < 0:
            return

        if target == 0:
            ans.append(path[:])
            return
        
        for i in range(idx, len(candidates)):
            path.append(candidates[i])
            # target -= candidates[i] #WRONG
            self.backtrack(candidates, target - candidates[i], i, path, ans)
            path.pop()

    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans = []

        self.backtrack(candidates, target, 0, [], ans)

        return ans
```
