### Solutions

Heap (Priority Queue)

Note:\
`heapq.heapify(heap)`:\
heapify the queue in-place.
WRONG: \
`heap1, heap2 = heapq.heapify(costs[:candidates])` return None.

Idea:
- the problem asks to:
  - select `k` workers from `costs` to have min costs. 
  - each turn select 1 worker from first and last `candidates` # of `costs` (workers). select min cost w/ min index.
- One more worker to added in heap each turn: set 2 pointers.
- check if heap_head and heap_tail still valid.
  
TC: O((m+k)*lgn), SC: O(m) - m: # of `candidates`

```python
class Solution:
    def totalCost(self, costs: List[int], k: int, candidates: int) -> int:     
        # WRONG:
        # heap1, heap2 = heapq.heapify(costs[:candidates]), heapq.heapify(costs[max(candidates, len(costs)-candidates):])
        heap1, heap2 = costs[:candidates], costs[max(candidates, len(costs)-candidates):]
        heapq.heapify(heap1)
        heapq.heapify(heap2)
        next_head, next_tail = candidates, len(costs)-candidates-1
        cost = 0
        ans = 0

        for _ in range(k):
            if not heap1 or not heap2:
                cost = heapq.heappop(heap1) if not heap2 else heapq.heappop(heap2)
            elif heap1 and heap2:
                min_cost1 = heapq.heappop(heap1)
                min_cost2 = heapq.heappop(heap2)

                if min_cost1 <= min_cost2: # use min_cost1
                    heapq.heappush(heap2, min_cost2)
                    cost = min_cost1
                    if next_tail >= next_head: 
                        heapq.heappush(heap1, costs[next_head])
                        next_head += 1
                else: # use min_cost2
                    heapq.heappush(heap1, min_cost1)
                    cost = min_cost2
                    if next_tail >= next_head: 
                        heapq.heappush(heap2, costs[next_tail])
                        next_tail -= 1

            ans += cost
            
        return ans
```
