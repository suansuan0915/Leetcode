### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  DFS.

  Idea:
  - to get result, we need to chain dividend and divisor by "path". The problem turns to "if we can get from dividend to divisor by path", so we can use graph method.
  - Like we did in `#1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero`, we first get graphs for nodes.
  - then for each query, we check 3 conditions: any element not in graph; elements are same; elements not the same.
  - Find path by path: during the process: `target` always the same, and change `curr` path by path.

  Note:
  - if `res` is found, break the for loop (that's why initiate a `res` value first).
  - whenever return to previous level, backtrack by removing `curr` node from `visited`.

  `N`: the number of input equations. \
  `M`: the number of queries.\
  TC: O(MN) - O(N) + M * O(N), SC: O(N)

```python
class Solution:
    def calcEquation(self, equations: List[List[str]], values: List[float], queries: List[List[str]]) -> List[float]:
        graph = collections.defaultdict(defaultdict)
        visited = []
        ans = []

        for (dividend, divisor), val in zip(equations, values):
            graph[dividend][divisor] = val
            graph[divisor][dividend] = 1/val

        for dividend, divisor in queries:
            if dividend not in graph or divisor not in graph:
                res = -1.0
            elif dividend == divisor:
                res = 1.0
            else:
                res = self.getPath(dividend, divisor, 1, graph, visited)
            ans.append(res)

        return ans

    def getPath(self, curr, target, acc_product, graph, visited):
        visited.append(curr)
        res = -1
        neighbors = graph[curr]

        if target in neighbors:
            res = acc_product * neighbors[target]
        else:
            for ele, val in neighbors.items():
                if ele in visited:
                    continue
                res = self.getPath(ele, target, acc_product * neighbors[ele], graph, visited)
                if res != -1:
                    break
        visited.remove(curr)
        
        return res
```
