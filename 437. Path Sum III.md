# [437. Path Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

Medium

### Solutions
DFS.

Idea:
- Why not use "targetSum decreasing" like other Path Sum problems (#112, #113):\
  becoz here we not only want path from root, but also path from middle nodes. Decreasing targetSum requires stemming from root.
  So instead we use cumulative sum.

Note:
- Why not use `cm_sum -= root.val`:\
  cm_sum is integer, which is immutable. so it's local to its current call. Another calls don't affect. Unlike mutable lists (hm).
- Don't use `cnt` in recursion function `dfs()` to get answer:\
  becoz `cnt` is integer, immutable, which will be local to current call.\
  When backtracking and return answer, the parent call will return original value of `cnt` in its current call, which is 0.
  --> Solution: use `root + left + right` instead.
- Backtrack hashmap `hm` in recursion:\
  becoz dictionary is mutable, which will affect other calls. So we need to backtrack when go back to root nodes.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> int:
        self.targetSum = targetSum
        hm = collections.defaultdict(int)

        return self.dfs(root, 0, hm)
        
    def dfs(self, root, cm_sum, hm):
        if not root:
            return 0

        cm_sum += root.val

        added_cnt = 1 if cm_sum == self.targetSum else 0
        added_cnt += hm[cm_sum - self.targetSum]  #if no exists, hm[] returns 0

        hm[cm_sum] += 1

        added_left = self.dfs(root.left, cm_sum, hm)
        added_right = self.dfs(root.right, cm_sum, hm)

        # cm_sum -= root.val  # cm_sum is integer, which is immutable. so it's local to its current call. Another calls don't affect. Unlike mutable lists (hm).
        hm[cm_sum] -= 1

        return added_cnt + added_left + added_right
```
