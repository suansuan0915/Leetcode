### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  iterate from left to right: while a height >= prev, check until no further unqualified heights in ans;
  then append qualified i and go further right.

  Idea:
  - see if any pre-added building (on left) is blocked by the new building (ongoing right).

  TC: O(n), SC: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def findBuildings(self, heights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ### Method 2:
        ## iterate from left to right
        ans = []

        for i in range(len(heights)):
            while ans and heights[i] >= heights[ans[-1]]:
                ans.pop()
            ans.append(i)

        return ans
```

- Method 2:\
  Monotonic stack.

  Idea:\
  if new will block other on left.
  - while new buidling > buidling-in-stack: ok. new can be new-tallest, so pop stack first and add new.
  - if stack is none: no higher building on the right. add new to ans and stack.
  - if stack is not none: some higher on right. don't add to ans, but add to stack in case this new is higher than other on left.

  Note:
  - `sequence.reverse()` return same data type as `sequence` (**prefer!**). `sequence` can be list/string/etc.\
    `reversed(sequence)` return a iterator.

  TC: O(n), SC: O(n)
```python
class Solution:
    def findBuildings(self, heights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []

        for i in range(len(heights)-1, -1, -1):
            if not stack:
                stack.append(i)
            elif heights[stack[-1]] < heights[i]:
                stack.append(i)
            else:
                continue

        stack.reverse()
        return stack
```

- Method 3:\
  Monotonic Stack w/ Space Optimization:\
  keep update tallest on right side, add to ans if higher that tallest-on-right.
  
  TC: O(n), SC: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def findBuildings(self, heights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(heights)
        tallest = heights[n-1]
        ans = [n-1]

        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            if heights[i] > tallest:
                ans.append(i)
                tallest = heights[i]

        return reversed(ans)  #not optimal: sorted(ans)
```
