## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

:alarm_clock: Feb 17

### Two Pointers - Sliding Window
Expanding r until window\[r\] > 1, then stop and shrink l until window\[r\] <= 1.

#### Code:
```python

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        ## Method 1:
        # Two Pointers - Sliding Window
        # TC: O(N), SC: O(N)
        l, r = 0, 0
        window = dict()
        res = 0
        while r < len(s):
            a = s[r]
            r += 1
            if a not in window:
                window[a] = 1
            else:
                window[a] += 1
            while window[a] > 1:
                b = s[l]
                l += 1
                window[b] -= 1
            res = max(res, r-l)
        return res


```
