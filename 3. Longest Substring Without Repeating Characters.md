### Two Pointers - Sliding Window
Similar problems:  #3, #209, #

Know when to expand r pointer and shrink l pointer:\
initiate l pointer at index 0, then r pointer in for-loop. With r iteration, shrink l.

### Solutions:

- Method 1:\
  Slidig Window.\
  TC: O(n)\
  SC: O(n)

  Pointers l and r starting from index 0. r keeps expanding to right, stores each character in a hash table w/ key=character and value=index.\
  When r meets a duplicate character, shrinks l (moves l pointer to the position 1 step right to the r's last index which is stored in hash table, NOT a step to right! -> image example like `abcc` when comes to 2nd `c`).\
  keep length as `r-l+1`.

OR:

```python

        l = 0
        dic = collections.defaultdict()
        max_len = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            if s[r] in dic and l <= dic[s[r]]:
                l = dic[s[r]] + 1
            else:
                max_len = max(max_len, r-l+1)
            dic[s[r]] = r

        return max_len
```

OR **with while loop**
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        l, r = 0, 0
        dic = dict()
        max_length = 0

        while r < len(s):
            if s[r] not in dic \
                or (s[r] in dic and dic[s[r]] < l):  # possibly some digit is used in prev abandoned run, and hasn't been meet dup before. This doesn't affect the digit in current run. (e.g.: t in 'tmmabct')
                    dic[s[r]] = r
                    max_length = max(max_length, r-l+1)
            elif s[r] in dic and dic[s[r]] >= l:
                # max_length = max(max_length, r-l) #if dup now, no need to update max_length
                l = dic[s[r]] + 1
                dic[s[r]] = r
            r += 1
