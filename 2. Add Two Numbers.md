### Notes

#### **LinkedList**

- If there is a LinkedList `l1`, cannot say `l1.head`, error raised:\
  <img width="432" alt="image" src="https://github.com/suansuan0915/Leetcode/assets/51430523/aec65cb3-f8f9-4adb-8e58-e7bae9db0d8b">

- Dummy node as initial starting point: `curr = dummy_code` to start.\
  To move forward the linkedlist:
  ```
  curr = new_node
  curr = curr.next
  ```
  To return the head of result linkedlist: `return dummy_node.next`

- Problem meaning:\
  Two arrays add together like summation.\
  So we only need to go from the linkedlist direction and do sum digit-by-digit, if sum >= 10, we add (sum//10) to next digit and use the mod (sum%10) as current node's value.

- Edge Cases:
  ```
  l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9],
  l2 = [9,9,9,9]
  Expected = [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
  ```

### Solutions

- Method:\
  TC: O(max(m,n))\
  SC: O(1) <- since we don't count answer as space complexity.
  
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        ## specify a dummy node as starting point:
        dummy_head = ListNode(0)
        curr = dummy_head
        add_prev = 0

        ## add_prev is added as part of while condition, because of edge case:
        while l1 or l2 or add_prev != 0:
            ## use if statement here in case the edge case where l1 or l2 node is None:
            l1_val = l1.val if l1 else 0
            l2_val = l2.val if l2 else 0
            sum_ud = l1_val + l2_val + add_prev
            ## if statement conditions can be merged:
            # if sum_ud >= 10:
            add_prev = sum_ud // 10
            remainder_cur = sum_ud % 10
            # else:
            #     add_prev = 0
            #     remainder_cur = sum_ud
            # curr.next.val = remainder_cur
            new_node = ListNode(remainder_cur)
            ## None value error raised for curr.next if curr is None:
            # curr = curr.next 
            curr.next = new_node
            curr = curr.next
            ## Cannot use "l1.next" as if condition, becoz l1 can be None (like the edge case):
            ## Cannot specify "else 0" here, becoz val=0 is still a valid node:
            l1 = l1.next if l1 else None
            l2 = l2.next if l2 else None

        return dummy_head.next
```
