### Notes

- `list.reverse()`:\
  In-place list reversal
  
- Edge case:\

  *Wrong idea:*\
  Think of the problem as determined by col%2==0 column or col%2!=0 column, the nodes to be added into q is from left to right or right to left.\
  Wrong, because: like this edge case, if reversely added the nodes to q from right to left, then in next level (where suppose to traverse from left to right), right parent node would be traverse first so as its child which is on right side.\
  Correct idea:\
  Traverse all nodes on same level normally from left to right, after that, reverse the order. 

#### Solutions:

- Method 1:\
   BFS method\
    left->right normal order to traverse root, BUT just need to add to ans by diverse order.\
    -> `temp` order should vary

```python

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def zigzagLevelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        ## mETHOD 1:
        # BFS + binary tree
        # TC, SC: O(N)
        if not root:
            return []
        
        q = collections.deque([root])
        level = 0
        temp = []
        ans = []

        while q:
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                curr = q.popleft()
                temp.append(curr.val)
                if curr.left:
                    q.append(curr.left)
                if curr.right:
                    q.append(curr.right)
            if temp:
                temp if level % 2 == 0 else temp.reverse()
                ans.append(temp)
                temp = []
            level += 1

        return ans    
```

:warning: **Attention**\
Wrong idea\
same as #102\
append cur.val, NOT cur node\
Check if cur is null, otherwise don't append to temp
