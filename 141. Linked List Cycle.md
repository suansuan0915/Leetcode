## 141. Linked List Cycle 

:alarm_clock: Jan 30

### LinkedList + Two Pointers

fast (p1, 2 steps/walk) and slow pointer (p2, 1 step/walk):\
since gap distance between p1 and p2 would +=1 each walk, p2 and p1 would finally meet if any cycle exists.\
if no cycle, p1 would reach a null node finally.

```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        ## Method 1:
        # LinkedList + Two Pointers
        # TC: O(N), SC: O(1)
        p1, p2 = head, head
        while p1 and p1.next:
            p1 = p1.next.next
            p2 = p2.next
            if p1 == p2:
                return True
        return False
        
```

### Where is the start of cycle?
First, p1 (fast) and p2 (slow) meet in the cycle;\
then, move p2 back to head, let two pointers walk at the same pace, then after walking (k-m), meet at the start of cycle.\
