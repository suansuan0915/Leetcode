# [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150) 

Easy

### Notes

If there is a node, no matter the value is 0 or not, it is evaluated to be `not None`.\
So we can say `if node` equals to `if node is not None`.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Hash table.\
  TC: O(n), SC: O(n)
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        nodes = set()
        current = head

        while current is not None:
            if current in nodes:
                return True
            nodes.add(current)
            current = current.next
        
        return False
```

- Method 2:\
  Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm:\
  LinkedList + Two Pointers

fast (p1, 2 steps/walk) and slow pointer (p2, 1 step/walk):\
since gap distance between p1 and p2 would +=1 each walk, p2 and p1 would finally meet if any cycle exists.\
if no cycle, p1 would reach a null node finally.

- Note:\
    Since we check `fast.next.next`: when checking `node.next` in LinkedList, pay attention to what if the node is None. In that case, error can be raised:\

TC: O(n), SC: O(1)

- Method 2.1:\
Since while loop is `fast!=slow`, we need to specify different starting positions for fast and slow pointers. \
If there's loop, no matter where do they start, w/ different speed, they can finally meet.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        if head is None:
            return False

        fast, slow = head.next, head
        while fast != slow:
            if fast is None or fast.next is None:
                return False
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
        
        return True
```

OR: 
- Method 2.2:\
  If we want the pointers start from same position:\
  in this case, don't compare when they are still at starting position which is head (because otherwise it will return True which is not correct). Compare after they have at least one move.
```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        ## Method 1:
        # LinkedList + Two Pointers
        # TC: O(N), SC: O(1)
        p1, p2 = head, head
        while p1 and p1.next:
            p1 = p1.next.next
            p2 = p2.next
            if p1 == p2:
                return True
        return False
        
```

### Where is the start of cycle?
First, p1 (fast) and p2 (slow) meet in the cycle;\
then, move p2 back to head, let two pointers walk at the same pace, then after walking (k-m), meet at the start of cycle.\
