## 876. Middle of the Linked List

:alarm_clock: Jan 30

### LinkedList + Two Pointers

- **WHY "two pointers" when linkedlist:**\
When linkedlist is asked with length question, **"two pointers" method** helps to solve in one pass O(N)

- **WHY no dummy node here?**\
No possible null node at the very beginning of linkedlist.

- Idea for this Q:\
p1 walks first w/ 2 steps, followed by p2 w/ 1 step\
-> Check p1 and p1.next first, stop walking when p1 is None\
No worries with p1.next.next is None now
In this case, if\
`node1 ---> node2 (p2) ---> node3 (p1) ---> node4 ----> null`\
after one walk\
`node1 ---> node2 ---> node3 (p2) ---> node4 ----> null (p1, formally p1.next.next)`\
Satisfy `If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.`

#### Code:
```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        ## Method 1:
        # LinkedList + Two Pointers
        # TC: O(N), SC: O(1)
        p1, p2 = head, head
        while p1 and p1.next:
            p1 = p1.next.next
            p2 = p2.next
        return p2

```
