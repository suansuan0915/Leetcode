### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Heap.

  Idea:
  - Prioritize most freq tasks in one cycle (n+1, as any task+idles). 
  - In the same cycle, after using one task, use the next freq task.
  - Prefer list than hashmap here: easier to check if any tasks left w/ O(1).
  - why use `ans=0` and another `tasks_cnt=0` in inner cycle:
    - becoz it's easier to track if we need to add a standard cycle `n+1` to final `ans` or we just have less than a full cycle's elements.
    - Therefore: after each task scheduling cycle, we first add back to heap and check if it's still valid. If not null heap, means we have
      full tasks of n+1 in previous cycle; if null heap, means we don't need further scheduling, just add what we have in previous cycle (it can be full cycle n+1 or part of it, where `tasks_cnt` comes into play).

  Note:
  - becoz we don't care what exact tasks in each location, we just want to use up all tasks.

  TC: O(n), SC: O(1) - only 26 letters from A to Z.

```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        ans = 0

        # 1. build freq list
        freq = [0] * 26
        for task in tasks:
            freq[ord(task) - ord('A')] += 1

        # 2. build heap
        pq = [-v for v in freq if v > 0]
        heapq.heapify(pq)

        # 3. construct scheduler
        while pq:
            cycle = n + 1
            store = []
            tasks_cnt = 0
            while cycle > 0 and pq:
                candidate_task = heapq.heappop(pq)
                if -candidate_task > 1:
                    store.append(candidate_task + 1)
                cycle -= 1
                tasks_cnt += 1
            for v in store:
                heapq.heappush(pq, v)
            ans += (n + 1) if pq else tasks_cnt

        return ans
```
