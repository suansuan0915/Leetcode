### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Recursion - DFS:\
  clone node, and traverse neighbors to get it's cloned neighbor.

  Note: `visited={}` must be separately set up in `def __init__(self):`.

  `n`: # of nodes. `m`: # of edges.
  TC: O(m+n), SC: O(n) - visited + recursion stack (height of graph O(h))

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
"""

from typing import Optional
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.visited = dict()

    def cloneGraph(self, node: Optional['Node']) -> Optional['Node']:
        if not node:
            return 

        if node in self.visited:
            return self.visited[node]

        clone_node = Node(node.val, [])
        self.visited[node] = clone_node
        
        if node.neighbors:
            clone_node.neighbors = [self.cloneGraph(n) for n in node.neighbors]

        return clone_node
```


- Method 2:\
  Iteration - BFS:\
  visit each node and store in queue, then clone and append its neighbors to queue and visited, also add each neighbor to its clone.neighbors.

  same as Method 1.

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
"""

from typing import Optional
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: Optional['Node']) -> Optional['Node']:
        ### Method 2:
        ## Iteration - BFS
        if not node:
            return 
            
        queue = deque([node])
        visited = {}
        visited[node] = Node(node.val, [])

        while queue:
            curr = queue.popleft()
            for n in curr.neighbors:
                if n not in visited:  # in graph, nodes can be revisited (diff from binary tree)
                    visited[n] = Node(n.val, [])
                    queue.append(n)
                visited[curr].neighbors.append(visited[n])

        return visited[node]
```
