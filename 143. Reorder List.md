# [143. Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/description/)

Medium

### Solutions:
**Combination of Q876, Q206, Q21**

Idea:
- split the linkedlist into 2 halves: first, find mid point, then split. (Q876)
- reverse 2nd half. (Q206)
- merge 2 halves nodes interchangeably: (difference w/ Q21) per cycle:  `list1 -> list2 -> list1_next`.


Note:
- When merge 2 lists: \
  we just need to modify the original list itself and don't need to return, so no need dummy prehead here.
- Difference w/ Q21: here we have 2 conditions: list1 and list2 have equal # of nodes, OR list2 has one more node.
  - So only list2 to consider in while loop condition.
  - becoz when list2 has left one more node, then left as it is (since already connect list1 to list2, remaining is just list2 and it's original connection).

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        ## 1. find mid node:
        p1, p2 = head, head
        while p2 and p2.next:
            p1 = p1.next
            p2 = p2.next.next
        # now p1 is the mid node

        ## 2. reverse 2nd half:
        prev = None
        curr = p1

        while curr:
            curr_next = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr  # now this is the start node of 2nd half
            curr = curr_next
        
        ## 3. Merge two linkedlist:
        list1, list2 = head, prev
        # WRONG: we just need to modify the original list itself and don't need to return, so no need dummy prehead here:
        # dummy = ListNode()
        # curr = dummy

        while list2.next:  # list1 and 
            list1_next, list2_next = list1.next, list2.next
            list1.next = list2
            list2.next = list1_next
            list1, list2 = list1_next, list2_next
```
