### Prefix Sum + Diff Array

Similar to **Q370**.

Three steps for preSum diff array method.

```python

class Solution:
    def corpFlightBookings(self, bookings: List[List[int]], n: int) -> List[int]:
        ## Method 1:
        # Prefix Sum + Diff Array
        # TC, SC: O(N)
        diff = [0] * n

        for pair in bookings:
            start, end, incre = pair
            start -= 1
            end -= 1
            diff[start] += incre
            if end+1 < n:
                diff[end+1] -= incre
        
        ans = [diff[0]]
        for i in range(1, n):
            arr_ele = ans[i-1] + diff[i]
            ans.append(arr_ele)
        return ans 

```
