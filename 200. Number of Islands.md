## 200. Number of Islands

:alarm_clock: Jan 18

### Notes
while loop: NONE, zero, empty container is "False".

Surrounding nodes: up/down/left/right direction.

`collections.deque()` must have `[ ]` as input.

### why SC?

### BFS + Matrix method
#### Code:

Note:
- Apart from mark node popped from q as '0', we should also mark visited neighbors as '0':\
    becoz if not, TLE error raised. Since visited '1' will be count as island that already counted, so we won't visit them as '1' again, so better to mark as '0' to improve efficiency.
- Neighbor coordinates' constraint:\
  Restrict not only row# but also column#.

TC: O(mn), SC: O(min(m,n)) -> draw an example to see.

```python

class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        ## Method 1:
        # BFS + Matrix
        # TC: O(M*N), SC: O(min(M,N))
        if not grid:
            return 0
        
        ans = 0
        row, col = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        direction = [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]

        for ix in range(row):
            for iy in range(col):
                if grid[ix][iy] == '1':
                    ans += 1
                    grid[ix][iy] = '0'
                    q = collections.deque([(ix, iy)])

                    while q:
                        ix_, iy_ = q.popleft()
                        for x, y in direction:
                            if 0 <= (ix_+x) < row and 0 <= (iy_+y) < col and grid[ix_+x][iy_+y] == '1':
                                grid[ix_+x][iy_+y] = '0'
                                q.append((ix_+x, iy_+y))

        return ans

```

:warning: **Attention**
- Order of "AND":\
Set coordinates constraints first, then for corresponding location's value.\
- matrix vs. tree:\
no direction for matrix, need to set 0 for visited nodes to avoid duplicate visits.
