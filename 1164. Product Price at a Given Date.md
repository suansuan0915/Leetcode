### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  UNION ALL, use `RANK` window function.
```mysql
WITH cte AS
(SELECT 
    product_id
    , new_price
    , RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY change_date DESC) AS ranks
FROM Products
WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16')

SELECT product_id, new_price AS price
FROM cte
WHERE ranks = 1
UNION ALL
SELECT DISTINCT product_id, 10 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE product_id IN (
    SELECT product_id 
    FROM Products
    GROUP BY product_id
    HAVING MIN(change_date) > '2019-08-16'
)
```

- Method 2:\
  UNION ALL, use `FIRST_VALUE` window function.
```mysql
SELECT 
    DISTINCT product_id
    , FIRST_VALUE(new_price) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY change_date DESC) AS price
FROM Products
WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
UNION ALL
SELECT product_id, 10 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE product_id IN (
    SELECT product_id 
    FROM Products
    GROUP BY product_id
    HAVING MIN(change_date) > '2019-08-16'
)
```
