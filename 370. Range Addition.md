## 370. Range Addition

:alarm_clock: Jan 25

### Prefix Sum - diff array （差分数组）

First, build diff array; then, modify (+/-) to diff on index i and index (j+1); finally, convert diff to array.

*Why + on index i, - on index (j+1)?*\
Between range [i+1, j], all numbers in array are added a same number, so diff of neighbor numbers won't change.\
But start position i would add increment value, while position (j+1) would decrease the value.

#### Code:
```python

class Solution:
    def getModifiedArray(self, length: int, updates: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        ## Method 1:
        # Prefix Sum + Diff array
        # TC: O(N), SC: O(N)
        # make diff array
        diff = [0] * length
        # modify diff
        for pair in updates:
            start, end, incre = pair
            diff[start] += incre
            if end+1 < length:
                diff[end+1] -= incre
        # convert diff to arr
        ans = [diff[0]]
        for i in range(1, length):
            arr_ele = ans[i-1] + diff[i] 
            ans.append(arr_ele) 
        return ans

```

:warning: **Attention**\
Check index (j+1) < length or not
