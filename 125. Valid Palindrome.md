# [125. Valid Palindrome]()

Easy

### Notes

- `.isalnum()`\
  check if a digit is a alphanumeric character.
- `.lower()`

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Two pointers.
  - CANNOT do:

  because:
  - `" "` has a space in it, so it has length 1.
  - `" "` is not none. `if not s:` equals to true when s is none.
  - when meeting first or second `if` and then move l or r pointer, then the pointer can move to another non-alphanumeric index.\
    also, `s[l].isalnum()` return boolean to represent if the digit is alphanumeric or not. We should use `s[l].lower()` to compare values instead.  

  - Do:\
    For every while loop: check only 1 condition:\
    if l is alnum?\
    if r is alnum?\
    or if l and r meets alnum condition, does their values equal? (if meet this, move both pointers inward)\
    if not meet all these three conditions, return false.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool: 
        l, r = 0, len(s)-1

        while l <= r:
            if not s[l].isalnum():
                l += 1
            elif not s[r].isalnum():
                r -= 1
            elif s[l].lower() == s[r].lower():
                l += 1
                r -= 1
            else:
                return False
        return True
```
