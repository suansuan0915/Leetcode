### Prefix Sum + Diff Array

- How to define diff length?\
Use constraints given by question.

- "pick up" at i then "drop-off" at j:\
[i, j-1] is incremented.

#### Code:
```python

class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        ## Method 1:
        # Prefix Sum + Diff Array
        # TC, SC: O(N)
        diff = [0] * 1001  # limit given by q

        for pair in trips:
            incre, start, end = pair
            diff[start] += incre
            diff[end] -= incre
        
        ans = [diff[0]]
        for i in range(1, len(diff)):
            arr_ele = ans[i-1] + diff[i]
            ans.append(arr_ele)

        print(ans)
        for n in ans:
            if n > capacity:
                return False
        return True

```
