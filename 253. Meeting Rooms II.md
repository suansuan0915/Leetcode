# [253. Meeting Rooms II](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=arhliijc)

## Priority Queue - Heap Data Structure

**heapq module**

`heapq.heapify(iterable)`

Heap:
- elements are sorted in DESC order.
- *Min-heap*: each time the smallest heap element is popped. `heap[0]`
- Whenever elements are pushed or popped, heap structure is maintained.

`heapq.heappush(heap, new_element)`\
`heapq.heappop(heap)`

### Solutions
- Method 1:\
  Priority queue / heap.\
  Idea: 
  - we first sort the meeting times by start time.
  - When a room can be accupied: it's either none meeting there, or the previous meeting has ended before current meeting's start time.\
    So when we have a current meeting to be scheduled, we check if the earliest meeting has ended (means if curr_start_time >= earlist_end_time).\
    becoz if it even smaller than earlist_end_time, we don't need to check other following meeting end time since they of course later than earlist one.
  - Then, after comparison:
    -  if current start_time >= earlist end_time: we accupied that room (technically, pop that element, replace w/ current elemnt.
    -  if otherwise: assign a new room (push the new element into heap).
  -  Finally, check how many elements inside the heap.
    
   TC: O(nlgn), SC: O(n).
```python
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        heap_ans = []

        heapq.heappush(heap_ans, intervals[0][1])

        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[i][0] >= heap_ans[0]:
                heapq.heappop(heap_ans)
            heapq.heappush(heap_ans, intervals[i][1])

        return len(heap_ans)
```

- Method 2:\
  Chronological Ordering.\
  Track `start_time`, `end_time`.\
  TC: O(nlgn), SC: O(n).
```python
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        start_times = sorted(interval[0] for interval in intervals)
        end_times = sorted(interval[1] for interval in intervals)

        rooms = 0

        start_idx, end_idx = 0, 0

        while start_idx < len(intervals):
            if start_times[start_idx] >= end_times[end_idx]:
                # room unchange
                rooms -= 1
                end_idx += 1
                
            # 1st round:
            rooms += 1
            start_idx += 1

        return rooms
```
