# [253. Meeting Rooms II](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=arhliijc)

## Priority Queue - Heap Data Structure

**heapq module**

`heapq.heapify(iterable)`

Heap:
- elements are sorted in DESC order.
- *Min-heap*: each time the smallest heap element is popped. `heap[0]`
- Whenever elements are pushed or popped, heap structure is maintained.

1st argument should be list, not None (`heapify([])` is None).
`heapq.heappush(heap, new_element)`\
`heapq.heappop(heap)`

### Solutions
- Method 1:\
  Priority queue / heap.
  
  Idea: 
  - we first sort the meeting times by start time.
  - When a room can be accupied: it's either none meeting there, or the previous meeting has ended before current meeting's start time.\
    So when we have a current meeting to be scheduled, we check if the earliest meeting has ended (means if curr_start_time >= earlist_end_time).\
    becoz if it even smaller than earlist_end_time, we don't need to check other following meeting end time since they of course later than earlist one.
  - Then, after comparison:
    -  if current start_time >= earlist end_time: we accupied that room (technically, pop that element, replace w/ current elemnt.
    -  if otherwise: assign a new room (push the new element into heap).
  -  Finally, check how many elements inside the heap.

```python
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        ans = 0

        pq = []
        heapq.heapify(pq)

        for interval in intervals:
            if not pq:
                ans += 1
                heapq.heappush(pq, interval[1])
            else:
                prev_int = pq[0]
                if interval[0] < prev_int:
                    heapq.heappush(pq, interval[1])
                    ans += 1
                else:
                    heapq.heappop(pq)
                    heapq.heappush(pq, interval[1])

        return ans
```

OR:

  
```python
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        heap_ans = []

        heapq.heappush(heap_ans, intervals[0][1])

        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[i][0] >= heap_ans[0]:
                heapq.heappop(heap_ans)
            heapq.heappush(heap_ans, intervals[i][1])

        return len(heap_ans)
```

OR:

Note:
- cannot do `heap = heapify([]), 
        heapq.heappush(heap, intervals[0][1])`, becoz:\
  heapq's 1st argument needs to be a list, but not None.
  
```python
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        heap = []
        heapq.heappush(heap, intervals[0][1])
        ans = 1

        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            start, end = intervals[i][0], intervals[i][1]
            if not heap or start < heap[0]:
                ans += 1
            else:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, end)

        return ans
```


- Method 2:\
  Chronological Ordering.
  
  Idea:\
  Track `start_time`, `end_time`:\
  we need a new room whenever current start_time is before the current earliest end_time.
  
  TC: O(nlgn), SC: O(n).
```python
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        starts = sorted([interval[0] for interval in intervals])
        ends = sorted([interval[1] for interval in intervals])
        p_start, p_end = 0, 0
        ans = 0

        while p_start < len(starts):
            if starts[p_start] < ends[p_end]:
                ans += 1
            else:
                p_end += 1
            p_start += 1

        return ans
```
