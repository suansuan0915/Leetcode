# [1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze](https://leetcode.com/problems/nearest-exit-from-entrance-in-maze/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

Medium

### Solutions
BFS - matrix.

Idea:
- BFS. whenever the cell is at the border, return.

Why BFS:
- becoz we want the "shortest" path:
  - DDFS is not guaranteed to find the shortest path, as it will explore the matrix as much as possible before moving on to another branch. 
  - BFS will go deeper 1 step each time, guaranteeing a shortest path.

Note:
- mark cells as "visited" once we append to q, otherwise duplicate cells will be appended.
- access a cell in a matrix: `matrix[row][col]`, NOT `matrix[row, col]`.
 
TC: O(m*n), SC: O(max(m,n))

```python
class Solution:
    def nearestExit(self, maze: List[List[str]], entrance: List[int]) -> int:
        directions = [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]
        m, n = len(maze), len(maze[0])
        q = collections.deque([entrance])
        maze[entrance[0]][entrance[1]] = '+'
        ans = 0

        while q:
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                curr_r, curr_c = q.popleft()
                if ans != 0 and (curr_r == 0 or curr_r == m-1 or curr_c == 0 or curr_c == n-1):
                    return ans
                for r, c in directions:
                    if 0 <= curr_r + r < m and 0 <= curr_c + c < n \
                        and maze[curr_r + r][curr_c + c] == '.':
                        q.append([curr_r + r, curr_c + c])
                        maze[curr_r + r][curr_c + c] = '+'
            ans += 1

        return -1
