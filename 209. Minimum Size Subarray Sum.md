# [209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Medium

### Notes

Cannot return variable with value `float('inf')`. Will raise type error.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  bute force:\
  two pointers start from 0.

  TC: O(n**2) - TLE, SC: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, 0
        sums = 0
        ans = float('inf')

        while r < len(nums):
            if sums + nums[r] >= target:
                ans = min(ans, r-l+1)
                l += 1
                r = l
                sums = 0
            elif sums + nums[r] < target:
                sums += nums[r]
                r += 1

        return ans if ans != float('inf') else 0
```


- Method 2:\
  Sliding Window.\
  Find array which meets requirement from index 0, then shrink from very left to get any smaller satisfied array (if exists). If left pointer \
  traverse all this array and not found any smaller satisfied window, continue move right pointer to right by 1 step. Then doing same thing.\
  Repeat until right pointer reaches index len(nums)-1.

  No need to move new r to new l after we move l rightward! (becoz if single num works, it should have been recorded before with addition of its prev numbers)

  TC: O(n)\
  SC: O(1)
```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:        
        l = 0
        cum_sum = 0
        min_length = float('inf')

        for r, val in enumerate(nums):
            cum_sum += val
            while cum_sum >= target and l <= r:
                min_length = min(min_length, r-l+1)
                cum_sum -= nums[l]
                l += 1
        
        return min_length if min_length == float('inf') else 0
```
