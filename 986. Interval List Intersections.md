### Solutions

Idea:
- Choose an interval from 1st list, compare w/ one from 2nd list. Then discard the one w/ smallest endpoint (becoz it won't have overlap w/
  others on the same list, and so does the next one on another list -> becoz intervals of both lists are *disjointed*).

Note:
- only OVERLAPs added:
  - when comparing and checking overlap in while loop, only add overlap.
  - when either list finishes, if intervals remaining in either i or j, it means the remains have no overlaps w/ those other list. So discard remainings.
- a valid range should have boundaries low<high.

TC: O(m+n), \
SC: O(m+n)\
why SC is not O(1) here?:
- any operation that increases answer size as the input size increas is part of BigO calculation. 

```python
class Solution:
    def intervalIntersection(self, firstList: List[List[int]], secondList: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans = []
        i, j = 0, 0

        while i < len(firstList) and j < len(secondList):
            interval1, interval2 = firstList[i], secondList[j]
            ## only OVERLAPs added!
            # if interval1[1] < interval2[0]:
            #     ans.append(interval1) 
            # elif interval1[0] > interval2[1]:
            #     ans.append(interval2) 
            # else:  
            ## if lo > hi, NOT a valid range
            lo = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])
            hi = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])
            if lo <= hi:
                overlap = [lo, hi]
                ans.append(overlap)
            
            if interval1[1] < interval2[1]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j += 1

            ## if intervals remaining in either i or j (after either end of list), it means the remains have no overlaps w/ those other list.
            
        return ans
```
