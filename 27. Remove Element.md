## 27. Remove Element

:alarm_clock: Feb 5

### Two Pointers + Array

what to return?\
since i would forward by 1 step every time after being assigned value, we should return slow pointer i instead of (i+1) as another similar Two Pointers Q.

#### Code:
```python

class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        ## Method:
        # Two Pointers + Array
        # TC: O(N), SC: O(1)
        i, j = 0, 0
        while j < len(nums):
            if nums[j] != val:
                nums[i] = nums[j]
                i += 1
            j += 1
        return i


```
