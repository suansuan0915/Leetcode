### Solutions

- Method:
  Prefix Sum.

  Idea:
  - Goal: we want a subarray with max-frequency nums as k (we don't care the length of subarray, as long as it has most k). finally return # of final k after modification.
  - So we need to include all numbers with original values as k (these k should be outside the interval we choose). We do NOTHING to them.
  - we also want to include numbers with same values, whose frequency is highest (becoz we just implement 1 action to the subarray to make them equal to k)

  Note:
  - `[7,2,2,2,7], k=2`: we already include k, so we drop 7 here and start over (freq_7 <= freq_2, if we compute w/ 7, more 2 will lose. not good.).

  TC: O(n), SC: O(n) - `ps`: n-length of nums. `freq`, `first`, `last`: constant 51-length.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxFrequency(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        ps = [0]
        freq = [0] * 51
        first, last = [-1] * 51, [-1] * 51
        extra = 0

        # 1. ps: numbers equal to k so far
        for num in nums:
            add = 1 if num == k else 0
            ps.append(ps[-1] + add)

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            v = nums[i]
            # 2. update freq, first, last
            if v == k:
                continue
            freq[v] += 1
            if first[v] == -1:
                first[v] = i
            last[v] = i

            # 3. get numbers of same values (more freq the better), exclude same values with k (becoz already include in qs)
            number_of_k = ps[last[v]+1] - ps[first[v]+1]
            net = freq[v] - number_of_k
            if net <= 0:
                first[v] = i
                freq[v] = 1
            extra = max(extra, net)

        return extra + ps[-1]
```
