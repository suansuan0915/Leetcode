# [155. Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Medium

### Note

- `tuple(obj)`:\
  can NOT be `tuple(val1, val2, val3)` type values, can only accept **one** value here.\
  Should be `tuple( (val1, val2, val3) )`.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Stack.

  **Idea:**
  - Push in O(1):\
    list, set, hashmap.
  - Pop in O(1):\
    list, set, hashmap.
  - Top in O(1):\
    list (by `list[-1]`).\
    set and hashmap are unordered, so cannot make it.
  - getMin in O(1):\
    list cannot make in O(1). hashmap and set as well.

  Therefore:\
  First, we think of a list to act as stack container here.\
  Second, with a list, we can push or pop or find the last element in O(1), but have difficulty with finding min in O(1).

  But we know the property of stack is LIFO. When value x is passed into stack, the min value so far is the min of all values BEFORE it.\
  That is, when the stack is empty, min is the 1st value passed in. When it is not empty, the min after 2nd value passed in is min(1st value, 2nd value). \
  So on and so forth, min turns out to be the min(current value, min of previous values so far). The following value poped or not doesn't affect the min at prev value.\
  --> So we can keep track of min for each value passed in. using a tuple (value, min_so_far) for each cell in the stack (tuple here to store in a list is better than two lists tracking val and min).

  Note:
  - If use `self.min_val` as min, we need to consider chnaging its value when:\
    pop() happens:
    - 1. after pop, stack is null.
    - 2. after pop, stack still has elements.
         
  TC: O(1)\
  SC: O(n) <- O(2n)

```python
class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.min_val = float('inf')

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.min_val = min(self.min_val, val)
        self.stack.append((val, self.min_val))

    def pop(self) -> None:
        if self.stack:
            pop_val = self.stack.pop()[0]
            if not self.stack:
                self.min_val = float('inf')
            else:
                if pop_val < self.stack[-1][1]:
                    self.min_val = self.stack[-1][1]
        else: 
            return -1

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1][0] if self.stack else -1

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1][1] if self.stack else -1


# Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MinStack()
# obj.push(val)
# obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.top()
# param_4 = obj.getMin()
```


OR:\
use `stack[-1][1]` as min_val_ever.
  
```python
class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        min_val = val if not self.stack else min(self.stack[-1][1], val)
        self.stack.append((val, min_val))

    def pop(self) -> None:
        if self.stack:
            pop_val = self.stack.pop()[0]
        else: 
            return -1

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1][0] if self.stack else -1

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1][1] if self.stack else -1
```
