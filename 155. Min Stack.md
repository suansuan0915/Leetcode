### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Stack.
  
  First, we think of a list to act as stack container here.\
  Second, with a list, we can push or pop or find the last element in O(1), but have difficulty with finding min in O(1).

  But we know the property of stack is LIFO. When value x is passed into stack, the min value so far is the min of all values below it.\
  That is, when the stack is empty, min is the 1st value passed in. When it is not empty, the min after 2nd value passed in is min(1st value, 2nd value). \
  So on and so forth, min turns out to be the min(current value, min of previous values so far).\
  --> So we can keep track of min for each value passed in. using a tuple (value, min_so_far) for each cell in the stack.

  TC: O(1)\
  SC: O(n) <- O(2n)
```python
class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        if self.stack:
            min_till_val = min(val, self.stack[-1][1])
            self.stack.append((val, min_till_val))
        else:
            self.stack.append((val, val))
        return

    def pop(self) -> None:
        self.stack.pop()
        return

    def top(self) -> int:
        if self.stack:
            return self.stack[-1][0]
        else:
            return

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        if self.stack:
            return self.stack[-1][1]
        else:
            return
```
