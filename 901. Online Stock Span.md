# [901. Online Stock Span](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

Medium

### Solution
Monotonic stack.

Idea:
- not regular Monotonic Stack problem:\
  becoz we may also need to count the smaller # which was popped out in previous turn.\
    ---> track the smaller # for each number. add it instead of 1 in regular problem.

example: `[[],[100],[80],[60],[70],[60],[75],[85]]`.\
when current=75, count 60,70,and also the popped 60 before 70.

```python
class StockSpanner:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def next(self, price: int) -> int:
        ans = 1
        while self.stack and self.stack[-1][0] <= price:
            ans += self.stack[-1][1]
            self.stack.pop()
        self.stack.append((price, ans))

        return ans
        


# Your StockSpanner object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = StockSpanner()
# param_1 = obj.next(price)
```
