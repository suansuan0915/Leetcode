### Notes

Notice: matrix can change which would misleading following steps.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  1st reversal: record cells with 0. \
  2nd reversal: in-place update any cell that any of the coordinates in the records to 0.\
  TC: O(r*c), SC: O(r+c) -> use extra space for 0 records, and the data structure is set (so not r*c).
```python
class Solution:
    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        r, c = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        r_record, c_record = set(), set()

        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    r_record.add(i)
                    c_record.add(j)

        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                if i in r_record or j in c_record:
                    matrix[i][j] = 0
```

- Method 2:\
  Save space w/ first row and first column as indicator to see if the row or column needs to be changed to 0.\
  The updating order is: first update inside boundary(indicators), then update indicator (1st row & 1st column).\
  **NOTICE**:\
  after we flag 1st row and 1st column and we are about to update cells to 0, we cannot traverse and update from position [0,0]\
  (if we do that, then some positions in 1st row or 1st column which are not suppose to be the indicator cells, will be changed to 0. Then if we proceed to next row/column,
  this will be misleading so we can have more wrong zeros in the answer).\
  --> Therefore, we first update cells except 1st row and 1st column (instead we use them as indicator first), and update zeros inside those "indicator boundary".
  After that, we use boolean value to represent if 1st row and 1st column have zero values to decide how to deal with 1st row and 1st column.\
  TC: O(r*c), SC: O(1).

        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    if i == 0:
                        first_row_has_zero = True
