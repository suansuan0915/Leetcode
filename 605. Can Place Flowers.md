### Solutions
- Method 1:
  
  Idea:
  - If the spots that can plant >= n, then return True.
  - Therefore, only check 0 to see if it can plant:\
    check left and right plots.
    - Note: check if left or right exists; plant it if possible (change 0 to 1) after checking and then move forward.

  `OR` operator uses short-circuit evaluation: \
     if 1st condition is true, 2nd condition will not be evaluated.

  TC: O(n), SC: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        can_plant = 0

        for i in range(len(flowerbed)):
            if flowerbed[i] == 0:
                left_able = (i == 0) or (flowerbed[i-1] == 0)
                right_able = (i == len(flowerbed) - 1) or (flowerbed[i+1] == 0)
                if left_able and right_able: 
                        can_plant += 1
                        flowerbed[i] = 1
        
        # OR: return True if can_plant >= n else False
        return can_plant >= n
```
