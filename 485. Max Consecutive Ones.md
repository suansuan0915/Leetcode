### Solutions
Idea: 
- when r is not 1 and move r forward until find 1, starting point l should be reset w/ r together.
- whenever r is 1, compute max_len (otherwise error when edge cases), move r forward and let l stay as starting point.

Edge cases: \
[1,1], [0,0,0]

TC: O(n), SC: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, 0
        max_len = 0

        while r < len(nums):
            if nums[r] == 1:
                max_len = max(max_len, r-l+1)
                r += 1
            else:
                r += 1
                l = r
        
        return max_len
```
