# [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/editorial/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Easy

### Linked List Basics

### Notes
- Dummy node as the 1st node in linkedlist.

- One of lists can be run off first.

- Notice change 3 key points:
  - connect cur and next node
  - cur
  - list head

- Why use `while list1 and list2` and separate conditions of either one or both lists are None condition? Unlike [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150):\
  Because here if any one or both linkedlists are None, it means remaining numbers in that sorted list are larger than curr node, so we can simply connect to the nodes in that list and no extra comparison needed, unlike problem 2. So we separate the conditions.
  

### Solutions
```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        ## Method 1:
        # Linked List
        # TC: O(M+N), SC: O(1)
        dummy = ListNode()  # not changed, for final return
        cur = dummy  # change as current node

        while list1 and list2:
            if list1.val <= list2.val:
                cur.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                cur.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next
            cur = cur.next

        # If any list runs off, but another doesn't
        # just connect, no need to reser cur, list head
        if list1 or list2:
            cur.next = list1 if list1 else list2
        
        return dummy.next

```
