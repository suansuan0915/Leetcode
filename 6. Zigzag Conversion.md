### Notes

See Editorial.

We can find the layout is like:\

Numbers are scattered in matrix with this pattern, divided into each section:\
numRows is as given, then diagonal.

---> So first create an empty matrix, then fill in with elements in s one-by-one. Finally traverse the matrix row by row.

- Edge case:\
`Whatever s is, numRows=1`\
Whatever s is, if numRows=1, elements in s are only in one row. So return s.

- `string.replace(oldvalue, newvalue, [count])`\
  replace to return a new value, NOT in-place.

### Solutions:

- Method 1:\
  Fill in matrix and traverse.

  Note:
  - s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), ',' and '.'.
  - we can use a inexact cols, since we constraint idx in filling step, no worry about index error.

  WRONG code:
  ```wrong
  i = 0
  r, c = 0, 0
  while i < len(s):
      while r < numRows and i < len(s):
          grid[r][c] = s[i]
          i += 1
          r += 1
      r -= 1
      while c < num_cols and r > 0 and i < len(s):
          #WRONG: we check r and c in while loop, but before assignment, we change them and assign w/o checking.
          r -= 1
          c += 1
          grid[r][c] = s[i]
          i += 1
      r += 1
  ```
  
```python
class Solution:
    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:
        if numRows == 1:
            return s

        n = len(s)
        sections = ceil(n / (numRows * 2 - 2))
        numCols = sections * (numRows - 1)
        matrix = [[' '] * numCols for _ in range(numRows)]
        ans = ''

        currRow, currCol = 0, 0
        sIdx = 0

        while sIdx < n:
            while currRow < numRows and sIdx < n:
                matrix[currRow][currCol] = s[sIdx]
                currRow += 1
                sIdx += 1
            
            currRow -= 2
            currCol += 1

            while currRow > 0 and currCol < numCols and sIdx < n:
                matrix[currRow][currCol] = s[sIdx]
                currRow -= 1
                currCol += 1
                sIdx += 1

        for line in matrix:
            ans += ''.join(line)

        ans = ans.replace(' ', '')

        return ans
```
