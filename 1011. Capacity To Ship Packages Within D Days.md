### Solutions

Binary search.

Idea:
- everyday load_min: max(weights). 船的最小载重应该是weights数组中元素的最大值，因为每次至少得装一件货物走，不能说装不下。\
    load_max: sum(weights). carry all in one day.

Notes: 
- when check days_used: base is 1. since final index weight cannot be check and add days.

TC: O(nlgn) - n * lg(500n), SC: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        lo, hi = max(weights), sum(weights)

        while lo <= hi:
            mid = lo + (hi - lo) // 2
            days_used = self.daysUsed(weights, mid)
            if days_used <= days:
                hi = mid - 1
            elif days_used > days:
                lo = mid + 1

        return lo

    def daysUsed(self, weights, capacity):
        sum_weight = 0
        days = 1

        for w in weights:
            if sum_weight + w <= capacity:
                sum_weight += w
            elif sum_weight + w > capacity:
                sum_weight = w
                days += 1

        return days
```
