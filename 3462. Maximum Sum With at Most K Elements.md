### Solutions

Heap / Priority Queue

Idea: 
- since we need top k largest #, we can use priority queue/heap.
- however, limits may affect the selection of top k. So we use limits to push # into pq, whenever pq exceeds k-length, pop:\
  becoz the (limits_sum-k) part to be popped is the smallest # in final pq. 
  Why makes sense: 
   - When we start to pop if exceeds k length, even if later a smaller # pushed in, 
it means it also exceeds k-length, so that smaller # will be poped as well.

TC: O(n\*mlgm + n\*mlgk), SC: O(m)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSum(self, grid: List[List[int]], limits: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        pq = []

        for row, limit in zip(grid, limits):
            row.sort(reverse=True)
            for i in range(limit):
                heapq.heappush(pq, row[i])
                if len(pq) > k:
                    heapq.heappop(pq)

        return sum(pq)
```
