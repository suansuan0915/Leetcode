# [111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/?envType=list&envId=57ksoa4v)

Easy

### BFS Notes

`q` stores all appended but unvisited nodes.\
`temp` stores nodes in current level.

- `while q`:\
  Key for `q` is **traverse**.\
  Key for `temp` is **store traversed/visited nodes on current level**.\
  Check if all nodes have been traversed. If so, the traversal complated. If not, continue.
-  `for _ in range(len(q)):`:\
  Key for `q` is **traverse**.\
  This is used for traversing unvisited nodes on current level. \
  after completing each full for loop, it means all nodes on current level have been visited. Ready to go into while loop and traverse other unvisited nodes on the next level in `q`.\
  Thus, it's time to do *actions based on each level*: like add depth, at this time. 

  If go without this for loop, we cannot control the action after each level.
 
### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  BFS - Find the shortest depth.\
  Since we are finding the shortest depth, we stop whenever find leaf node *at each level* (but not surpass some level).\
  Note: here each nodes on one level represent one depth.\
  TC: O(n), SC: O(1)
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0

        q = collections.deque([root])
        depth = 1

        while q:                
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                curr = q.popleft()
                if not curr.left and not curr.right:
                    return depth
                if curr.left:
                    q.append(curr.left)
                if curr.right:
                    q.append(curr.right)
            depth += 1
```
