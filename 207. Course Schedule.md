### Solutions

- Method 1:\
BFS - Topology, Kahn's algo

position[1] points to position[0] as pre-requisite.\
indegree track pointed-nodes' indrgree #.

First, build topology graph (indegree + neighbors); then, BFS.\
q acts as unvisited nodes for use. Also as "root" w/ no indegree.

If indegree=0, regard as "visited"\
-> indicating #visited is course we can learn and have finished all pre.\
-> Therefore, `numCourses==visited` defines if a course can be learned or not.

Note:
- `[[] for _ in range(numCourses)]` vs. `numCourses * [[]]`:\

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        ### Method 1:
        ## BFS - Topology, Kahn's algo
        indegree = numCourses * [0]
        adj = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]  # WRONG: numCourses * [[]]
        num_visited = 0
        
        for prereq in prerequisites:
            adj[prereq[1]].append(prereq[0])
            indegree[prereq[0]] += 1

        # search for leaves
        queue = deque()
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if indegree[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)

        # check cycle
        while queue:
            curr = queue.popleft()
            curr_neighbors = adj[curr]
            num_visited += 1
            for neighbor in curr_neighbors:
                indegree[neighbor] -= 1
                if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbor)

        return num_visited == numCourses

```

OR:
```python

class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        ## Method 1:
        # BFS + Topology
        # TC: O(V+E), SC: O(V+E)
        # 1. create topology
        edges = collections.defaultdict(list)
        indegree = [0] * numCourses
        visited = 0

        for pair in prerequisites:
            edges[pair[1]].append(pair[0])
            indegree[pair[0]] += 1

        # 2. BFS
        q_val = [x for x in range(numCourses) if indegree[x] == 0 ]
        q = collections.deque(q_val)

        while q:
            cur = q.popleft()
            visited += 1 
            for pointed_node in edges[cur]:
                indegree[pointed_node] -= 1
                if indegree[pointed_node] == 0:
                    q.append(pointed_node)

        return numCourses == visited

```

:warning: **Attention**\
one course can be pre for multiple courses.  ->  use `append`\
`q_val = [x for x in range(numCourses) if indegree[x] == 0 ]`
