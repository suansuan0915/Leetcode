## 207. Course Schedule

:alarm_clock: Jan 20

### BFS + Topology method
position[1] points to position[0] as pre-requisite.\
indegree track pointed-nodes' indrgree #.

First, build topology graph; then, BFS.\
q acts as unvisited nodes for use. Also as "root" w/ no indegree.

If indegree=0, regard as "visited"\
-> indicating #visited is course we can learn and have finished all pre.\
-> Therefore, `numCourses==visited` defines if a course can be learned or not.

#### Code:
```python

class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        ## Method 1:
        # BFS + Topology
        # TC: O(V+E), SC: O(V+E)
        # 1. create topology
        edges = collections.defaultdict(list)
        indegree = [0] * numCourses
        visited = 0

        for pair in prerequisites:
            edges[pair[1]].append(pair[0])
            indegree[pair[0]] += 1

        # 2. BFS
        q_val = [x for x in range(numCourses) if indegree[x] == 0 ]
        q = collections.deque(q_val)

        while q:
            cur = q.popleft()
            visited += 1 
            for pointed_node in edges[cur]:
                indegree[pointed_node] -= 1
                if indegree[pointed_node] == 0:
                    q.append(pointed_node)

        return numCourses == visited

```

:warning: **Attention**\
one course can be pre for multiple courses.  ->  use `append`\
`q_val = [x for x in range(numCourses) if indegree[x] == 0 ]`
