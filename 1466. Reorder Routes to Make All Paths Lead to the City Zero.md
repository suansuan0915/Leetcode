### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  DFS.

  Idea:
  - take down all possible path for each node (BOTH from-to and reversed to-from), then walk path by path to see if we need to reverse original path or not, increase count.

  why `self.dfs(neighbor, node, adj)` inside dfs function?
  - it's like go path by path to 0.

  TC: O(n), SC: O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        adj = collections.defaultdict(list)
        self.cnt = 0

        for fr, to in connections:
            adj[fr].append((to, 1))
            adj[to].append((fr, 0))

        self.dfs(0, -1, adj)

        return self.cnt

    def dfs(self, node, parent, adj):
        for neighbor, reverse_or_not in adj[node]:
            if neighbor != parent:
                self.cnt += reverse_or_not
                self.dfs(neighbor, node, adj)
```


- Method 2:\
  BFS.

  Idea:
  - check only nodes who haven't been visited yet (becoz visited nodes have already been deal with before).
    
  Same TC, SC.

```python
class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        adj = collections.defaultdict(list)
        self.cnt = 0

        for fr, to in connections:
            adj[fr].append((to, 1))
            adj[to].append((fr, 0))

        self.bfs(0, n, adj)

        return self.cnt

    def bfs(self, node, n, adj):
        q = deque([node])
        visited = [False] * n
        visited[node] = True

        while q:
            curr = q.popleft()
            for neighbor, reverse_or_not in adj[curr]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    self.cnt += reverse_or_not
                    q.append(neighbor)
```
