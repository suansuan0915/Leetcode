### Two Pointers - Sliding Window

*If one array contains another array*\
similar to **Q76**

Keep the s1 size of sliding window to shrink/expand l,r.

Thnk about 4 problems:
- When to expand r? What variables to update during the process?
- When to stop expanding r, and start expand l?
- What variables to update during the l expanding process?
- When and what to return?

#### Code:
```python

class Solution:
    def checkInclusion(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        ## Method 1:
        # Two Pointers - Sliding Window
        # TC: O(N), SC: O(N)
        # create dictionaries
        need, window = dict(), dict()
        for ele in s1:
            if ele not in need:
                need[ele] = 1
            else:
                need[ele] += 1
        
        l, r = 0, 0
        length = len(s1)
        valid = 0
        # expand r
        while r < len(s2):
            c = s2[r]
            r += 1
            if c in need:
                if c in window:
                    window[c] += 1
                else:
                    window[c] = 1
                if need[c] == window[c]:
                    valid += 1
            while (r - l) == length:  # keep s2 size window
                if valid == len(need):
                    return True
                d = s2[l]
                l += 1
                # move l out of window
                if d in need:
                    if need[d] == window[d]:
                        valid -= 1
                    window[d] -= 1
        return False

```
