# [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/)

Easy

**Linkedlist - change the order of nodes**
- by which node
- by condition of value k
- by reversal

### Solution
- Idea:\
  Purpose: change pointers between nodes to opposite direction, point first node to null.\
  1. Since we need to point 1st node to null and there's no prev pointer, initiate a `prev` pointer as None. (DONT do `#ListNode(val=None, next=head)`)
  2. Whenever a pointer is changed, we cannot access the original curr.next node. So we need to store it in advance before changing pointer.
  3. Move prev and `curr` after pointer changing each time.
- Note:\
  `prev = curr.next` vs. `curr.next = prev`:
    - 1st: Moves the prev pointer to point to the node that curr.next refers to. \
      This is just a pointer assignment and does not modify the linked list.\
     (used when keep track of the next node in the list without modifying the list's structure)
    - 2nd: changes the next pointer of the curr node to point to prev. \
     (used when modifying the connections between nodes)

WRONG:\
we need to store `prev.next` and `prev.next.next` in variables, otherwise, pointer change will cause infinite loop.

def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return None

        prev = ListNode(next=head)

        while pre.next:
            pre_next = pre.next
            pre_next.next = pre
            pre = pre_next

        return pre
```

#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = None
        curr = head

        while curr:
            next_curr = curr.next # save, otherwise cannot refer later
            curr.next = prev
            # for next iteration
            prev = curr
            curr = next_curr

        return prev
```
