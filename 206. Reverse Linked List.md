### Solution
- Idea:\
  Purpose: change pointers between nodes to opposite direction, point first node to null.\
  1. Since we need to point 1st node to null and there's no prev pointer, initiate a `prev` pointer as None.
  2. Whenever a pointer is changed, we cannot access the original curr.next node. So we need to store it in advance before changing pointer.
  3. Move prev and `curr` after pointer changing each time.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = None
        curr = head

        while curr:
            next_curr = curr.next # save, otherwise cannot refer later
            curr.next = prev
            # for next iteration
            prev = curr
            curr = next_curr

        return prev
```
