### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  DFS w/ equivalent graph.

Idea:
- since ans can be any node not in target's subtree, so we need to track node's parent.
- Add a parent pointer will easily cause error, so we decide to get neighbors for each nodes:
  - build a hashmap `graph`: nodes and their neighbors (left, right, parent).
  - then, traverse from `target` to get k-distance nodes.
 
Note:
- When traverse: Don't go back to visited nodes (becoz we came from `target` node and increase distance,
  if go to any visited node, error in distance computation).
- target node should never be revisited, becoz it's starting point. so add into original `visited`.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

        self.graph = defaultdict(list)

        self.ans = []

        self.buildGraph(root, None)
        self.searchK(target, 0)

        if not node:

        self.buildGraph(node.left, node)
        self.buildGraph(node.right, node)

    def searchK(self, node, distance):
        if distance == self.k:

            return

        for neighbor in self.graph[node]:
