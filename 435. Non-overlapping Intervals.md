# [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/description/)

Medium

### Solutions

- Method:\
  Greedy.
  
  "Finding the minimum number of intervals to remove" = "finding the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals".
  
  Choose the range w/ end time smaller the better. So in this case more non-overlapping intervals can be included as much as possible.

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        max_nonoverlap = 1
        nonoverlap = intervals[0]

        for interval in intervals:
            if interval[0] >= nonoverlap[1]:
                max_nonoverlap += 1
                nonoverlap = interval
            else:
                nonoverlap = [interval[0], min(nonoverlap[1], interval[1])]

        return len(intervals) - max_nonoverlap
```
