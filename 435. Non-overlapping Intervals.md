# [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/description/)

Medium

### Solutions

- Method:\
  Greedy.\
  "Finding the minimum number of intervals to remove" is equivalent to "finding the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals". \
  Choose the range w/ end time smaller the better. So in this case more non-overlapping intervals can be included as much as possible.

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        prev_end = intervals[0][1]
        ans = 0

        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            interval = intervals[i]
            if prev_end > interval[0]:
                ans += 1
            else:
                prev_end = interval[1]

        return ans
```
