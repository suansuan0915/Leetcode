# [134. Gas Station](https://github.com/suansuan0915/Leetcode/new/main)

Medium

### Notes

See Editorial.

Whenever the *accumulated* net gain <0, then the section with this starting point cannot be used. Then update the starting point to (i+1), and repeat.\
At the same time, keep track of total_gain for final answer usage. If total_gain >= 0, there exists a valid starting pointer; Otherwise, return -1.

### Solutions

- Method:\
  two pointers.
```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        total_gain = 0
        curr_gain = 0
        ans = 0

        for i in range(len(gas)):
            curr_gain += (gas[i] - cost[i])
            total_gain += (gas[i] - cost[i])
            if curr_gain < 0:
                curr_gain = 0
                ans = i+1

        return ans if total_gain >= 0 else -1
```
