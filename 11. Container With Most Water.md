Medium

### Notes

- an `if... else...` statement should include all possible conditions.\
  One easy-to-be-wrong situation here:\
  not including `=` condition in if statement, which causes TIME EXCEEDED error.

### Solutions

- Method:\
  Two Pointer.\
  We try to move pointers by getting to a higher wall (higher wall can contain more water in height).
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0

        while l < r:
            area = (r-l) * min(height[l], height[r])
            if area > max_area:
                max_area = area
            if height[l] >= height[r]:
                r -= 1
            elif height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
        
        return max_area
```
