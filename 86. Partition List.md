### Note
- In linkedlist, use dummy nodes while also keep variables for unchanged heads (for answer return purpose)
- How to reorder nodes in a linkedlist by a specific order
  
### Solution
- Idea: Reorder nodes by a specific condition:\
   Like separate nodes into two sections, one w/ value <x, another w/ value >=x.
  We just need to change the pointer connected and form two linkedlists, then use a pointer to connect them together.
- Note: need to specify the final node's pointer after changing the order of nodes (here reordered last node points to None). Otherwise a cycle will created.
- TC: O(n),\
  SC: since here we change pointers to form new linkedlist, we don't use extra space.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: Optional[ListNode], x: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return None

        before_head, after_head = ListNode(), ListNode()
        before_curr, after_curr = before_head, after_head
        curr = head

        while curr:
            if curr.val < x:
                before_curr.next = curr
                before_curr = before_curr.next
            else:
                after_curr.next = curr
                after_curr = after_curr.next
            curr = curr.next

        after_curr.next = None # otherwise create a cycle
        before_curr.next = after_head.next

        return before_head.next
```
