# [69. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/description/?envType=company&envId=amazon&favoriteSlug=amazon-thirty-days)

Easy

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Pocket calculator
  - like a simple calculator that can compute well exponential functions and natural logarithms by having logarithm tables hardcoded or by other means.
  - decompose the `x**(1/2)` into `e**(1/2 * logx)`.
 
  Note:
  - Edge cases: `x=0` (NO `log(0)`).
  - the answer `x` can be between `a` and `a+1`, like a square (see "Editorial").
 
  TC: O(1), SC: O(1)

```python
from math import e, log

class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        # x**(1/2) = e**(1/2 * logx)
        if x < 2:
            return x
            
        left = int(e ** (1/2 * log(x)))
        right = left + 1
        return left if right * right > x else right
```


- Method 2:\
  Binary search.

  TC: O(lgn), SC: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x < 2:
            return x

        l, r = 2, x//2

        while l <= r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if mid * mid == x:
                return mid
            elif mid * mid < x:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid - 1

        return r
        
```
