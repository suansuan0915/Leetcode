### Solutions
- Method 1:\
  Sliding window, for all unique characters in s.\
  Track char_cnt, move r to rightward.
  While different char's cnt (r-l+1-char_cnt) > k, keep move l (when moving l, it may affect char_cnt).
  
  *Edge case*:\
  when last char is different, but also meet the requirement of k. like `'BAAAB', k=2`.\
  Now 3 conditions:
  - s[r] == char: calculate max_length.
  - s[r] != char, but meets k: calculate max_length.
  - s[r] != char, not meets k as well: move l until meets k again.
  Therefore, max_length calculation should not be only inside `if s[r] == char` condition.

  TC: O(mn), SC: O(m), which at most be 26 (# of letters).

```python
class Solution:
    def isQualified(self, l, r, char_cnt, k):
        return (r - l + 1 - char_cnt) <= k

    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        s_set = set(s)
        max_length = 0

        for char in s_set:
            l, char_cnt = 0, 0
            for r in range(len(s)):
                if s[r] == char:
                    char_cnt += 1
                    max_length = max(max_length, r - l + 1)
                
                while not self.isQualified(l, r, char_cnt, k):
                    if s[l] == char:
                        char_cnt -= 1
                    l += 1

                max_length = max(max_length, r - l + 1)

        return max_length
```
