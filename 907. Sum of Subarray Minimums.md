### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Brute force.

  TC: O(n**3) - TLE, SC: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def sumSubarrayMins(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
        ans = 0

        for i in range(len(arr)):
            for j in range(i, len(arr)):
                ans += min(arr[i:j+1])

        return ans % MOD
```


- Method 2:\
  Monotonic stack - increasing.

  Idea:
  - Find when each element acts as min_num in their range, then compute `element_as_min_num * #_of_subarrays`.
  - How to compute `#_of_subarrays`:\
    use `min_num` as mid_point, becoz we need to include min_num in the subarray.
  - why include `i == len(arr)`:\
    when `i` goes through all indexes, if now the stack still has elements, we need to pop and compute;\
    and we want to do this after the stack is popped empty.
  - Duplicates:\
    whenever a number ready to be added is < or == stack[-1], mark it as the end boundary (becoz we want the element on that
    exact index to be end boundary, regardless of following same-value-number, that could be another story). 

  TC: O(n), SC: O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def sumSubarrayMins(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
        stack = []
        ans = 0

        for i in range(len(arr) + 1):
            # if not stack:
            #     stack.append(i)
            # elif stack and arr[i] > arr[stack[-1]]:
            #     stack.append(i)
            while stack and (i == len(arr) or arr[i] <= arr[stack[-1]]):
                end = i
                min_i = stack.pop()
                start = stack[-1] if stack else -1
                cnt = (min_i - start) * (end - min_i)
                ans += arr[min_i] * cnt
            stack.append(i)

        return ans % MOD
```
