# [92. Reverse Linked List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Medium

**Linkedlist - change the order of nodes**
- Reorder nodes by condition (node value)
- Reorder nodes by rotation (rotate n node)
- Reverse:
  - reverse whole list
  - reverse part of list:\
    reverse the part as vanilla reversal, the reconnect pointers of new head and tail nodes.

### Solution
- Note:\
  Repoint pointers of new head and tail.\
  Check null nodeï¼š
  - `prev` points to `r_prev`, `curr` points to `r_curr`.
  - `prev.next` can raise error if `prev` is None (when begin reverse from 1st node).
  - But `curr.next = r_curr` stands whenever r_curr is None (end reverse at the last node) or has value (end reverse at a in-between node).
