### Solutions
- Method 1:\
  Stack.
  
Idea:
- `current`: the webpage we are at currently.\
  `history`: webpage visited before.\
  `future`: webpages we can move forward when we are back some steps.
- "Last-in-first-out": 2 stacks.
- Note:
  - When newly visit a page, clear all pages in `future`.
  - When steps > possible back/forward steps: return as far as we can go.

`n`: # of visits. \
`m`: maximum # of steps to go back/forward. \
`l`: maximum length of url. \
TC: O(min(m,n)), SC: O(l*n). 

```python
class BrowserHistory:

    def __init__(self, homepage: str):
        self.history = []
        self.future = []
        self.current = homepage

    def visit(self, url: str) -> None:
        self.history.append(self.current)
        self.current = url
        # when visit a new url, clear all future pages
        self.future = []

    def back(self, steps: int) -> str:
        while steps > 0 and self.history:
        # for _ in range(steps):
            self.future.append(self.current)
            self.current = self.history.pop()
            steps -= 1
        return self.current

    def forward(self, steps: int) -> str:
        while steps > 0 and self.future:
            self.history.append(self.current)
            self.current = self.future.pop()
            steps -= 1
        return self.current


# Your BrowserHistory object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = BrowserHistory(homepage)
# obj.visit(url)
# param_2 = obj.back(steps)
# param_3 = obj.forward(steps)
```
