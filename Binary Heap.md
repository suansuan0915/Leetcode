*Full* binary heap.

Similar to binary tree, but instead of using node as pointers and stored in tree, \
binary heap is stored in array, uses index as pointers.

- **Max Heap**\
all nodes are larger than their child nodes.
- **Min Heap**

### Binary heap Operations
`swim()`\
`sink()`

## Priority Queue
based on binary heap
- operations\
`insert`\
`delMax` or `delMin`
