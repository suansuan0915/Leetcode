# [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

similar to 27. Remove Elements.

### Notes

Two Pointers + Array:

Since we want first k elements in array to be the unique numbers, consider use slow pointer to move w/ 1 step per time when find a different number, 
and change it to that different number, so we can get first k elements as the unique numbers. \
We cannot get that by moving or deleting, becoz that would change the array and affect indexing during the process.

Both pointers starts from index 0. If two pointers equal, move fast pointer forward, slow keeps at the original space; when fast 
goes to a different number position, move slow forward and then change it to that different number (this makes first k elements unique w/ SC O(1)), 
then move fast forward to find other numbers. Finally, result is (k+1), which is slow index(which starts from index 0) + 1.

example:\
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

### Solution

- Method:\
    Two Pointers + Array:\
    use p as placeholder for dedup number, compare mover pointer with its prev, if not equal, assign it to p, otherwise keep p unmoved and move mover pointer.

    TC: O(N), SC: O(1)

    Note:
  - check if mover pointer index is valid. 

    Edge case: `[1,1]`

while loop (less clean version)
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        p = 0
        mover = 0

        while mover < len(nums):
            while mover > 0 and mover < len(nums) and nums[mover] == nums[mover-1]:
                mover += 1
            if mover > len(nums)-1:
                break
            nums[p] = nums[mover]
            p += 1
            mover += 1

        return p
```

or:\
for loop (clean version)
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0

        p = 1

        for mover in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[mover] != nums[mover-1]:
                nums[p] = nums[mover]
                p += 1

        return p
````


OR:
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, 0

        while r < len(nums):
            if nums[r] != nums[l]:
                l += 1
                nums[l] = nums[r]
                r += 1
            elif nums[r] == nums[l]:
                r += 1

        return l+1
```
OR:
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        idx_to_fill = 0

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[idx_to_fill]:
                idx_to_fill += 1
                nums[idx_to_fill] = nums[i]
        
        return idx_to_fill+1

```
