### Solution

Method: \
Two pointers. (`j`, `k`)

Build on (n-1) round's encode for n round encode.

Understand what the problem means is the key:
- `j`: stays on the start point of consecutive subarray.
- `k`: fast pointers to count the # of same string represented by `j`.
- after k counting finishes, move slower pointer j to k's position and start a new count.
- Then we get a `next_encode` as the new `current_encode`, which used for next run in `n` for loop.
- starts from 1st step and repeat.

Note: 
- `current_encode` should stay the same during while loop process.\
  So we use next_encode as the changing result of encode during while loop (cannot use current_encode here. otherwise current_encode will be changing during while loop process).\
  Then after finishing while loop, we use current_encode=next_encode for next for loop run.

TC: O(4**(3/n)), SC: O(4**(3/n)).

```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        current_encode = '1'

        for i in range(n-1): # n=4
            next_encode = ''
            j, k = 0, 0
            while j < len(current_encode):
                while k < len(current_encode) and current_encode[j] == current_encode[k]:
                    k += 1
                next_subencode = str(k-j) + current_encode[j]
                next_encode += next_subencode  # cannot assign to current_encode
                j = k
            current_encode = next_encode

        return current_encode
```
