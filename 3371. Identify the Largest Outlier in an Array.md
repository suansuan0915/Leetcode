### Solutions
Hashmap.

Idea:
- sum of array \
  = sum_special_# + sum_of_special_# + outlier \
  = 2 * sum_of_special_# + outlier
- for each num as the potential sum_of_specials, check if outlier exists in hashmap (w/ value as freq).
- 2 conditions:
  - When outlier and sum_specials share different value.
  - When outlier and sum_specials share same value.
                                  
Edge case: \
When outlier and sum_specials share same value, but only 1 of them exists.
- `[6,-31,50,-35,41,37,-42,13]`, where if sum_of_special is 13, sum_all is 39, outlier is 13, but WRONG.   ---> so check the # of sum
- `[-6,0,-3,-3]`, where sums = -12.
- Why: `sums = outlier + 2 * sum_specials = outlier + sum_specials + (special_1 + special_2)`\
  so `sum_specials` cannot be 0, 

TC: O(n), SC: O(m) - `m`: the number of unique elements in the array.

```python
class Solution:
    def getLargestOutlier(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums_set = set(nums)
        cnts = collections.Counter(nums)
        sums = sum(nums)
        ans = float('-inf')

        for num in nums:
            outlier = sums - 2 * num
            if outlier in nums_set:
                if outlier != num or cnts[outlier] > 1:
                    ans = max(ans, outlier)

        return ans
```
