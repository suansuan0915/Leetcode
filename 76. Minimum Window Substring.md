## 76. Minimum Window Substring

:alarm_clock: Feb 16

### Two Pointers - Sliding Window
Steps for **Sliding Window**: 
- Create need, window dictionaries
- expand right pointer until covering all need elements
- optimize to get minimum window:\
  shrink (expand) left pointer

Thnk about 4 problems:\
- When to expand r? What variables to change during the process?
- When to stop expanding r, and start expand l?
- What variables to change during the l expanding process?
- When and what to return?

#### Code:
```python

class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        ## Method 1:
        # Two Pointers - Sliding window
        # TC: O(N), SC: O(N)
        # create need, window dictionary
        need, window = dict(), dict()
        for ele in t:
            if ele not in need:
                need[ele] = 1  
            else:
                need[ele] += 1
        
        l, r = 0, 0
        valid = 0
        start, length = 0, float('inf')  # for result array
        # expand right
        while r < len(s):
            c = s[r]
            r += 1
            if c in need:
                if c not in window:
                    window[c] = 1  
                else: 
                    window[c] += 1
                if window[c] == need[c]:
                    valid += 1
            while valid == len(need):
                # stop right move, start expand left
                if (r - l) < length:
                    start = l
                    length = r - l
                d = s[l]
                l += 1
                if d in need:
                    if window[d] == need[d]:
                        valid -= 1
                    window[d] -= 1
        if length != float('inf'):
            return s[start: start+length]
        else:
            return '' 

```
