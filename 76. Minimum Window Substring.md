## 76. Minimum Window Substring

:alarm_clock: Sep 19

### Two Pointers - Sliding Window
Steps for **Sliding Window**: 
- Create need, window dictionaries
- expand right pointer until covering all need elements
- optimize to get minimum window:\
  shrink (expand) left pointer

Thnk about 4 problems:
- When to expand r? What variables to change during the process?
- When to stop expanding r, and start expand l?
- What variables to change during the l expanding process?
- When and what to return?

### Solution
Two Pointers - Sliding window.

Move r rightward until a possible optimized window exits.\
Then shrink l, to see if another more possible optimized window exits. If so, keep shrink l rightward (as long as l<=r); if not, stop shrink l and move r instead.\
Continue as r<len(s).

Note:
- add anything meet in s window to window_dic. Also, decrease 1 to anything of l to window_dic when shrinking the window.
- We are keeping looking for optimized ranges l, r and optimized window. \
  - So only when a smaller window exists, we modify `min_len` and l, r (can not put l, r and min_len modification outside of if-statement).
  - Use `ranges` to keep track of optimized l and r, instead of using dynamic l,r (which can cause error, since not necessary to find another optimized window in the final try).

```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        t_dic = collections.Counter(t)
        window_dic = dict()
        formed = 0
        l, r = 0, 0
        ranges = [l, r]
        min_len = float('inf')

        while r < len(s):
            char = s[r]
            window_dic[char] = window_dic.get(char, 0) + 1
            if char in t_dic and window_dic[char] == t_dic[char]:
                formed += 1
            while l <= r and formed == len(t_dic):
                if r-l+1 < min_len:
                    min_len = min(r - l + 1, min_len)
                    ranges = [l, r]
                char = s[l]
                window_dic[char] -= 1
                if char in t_dic and window_dic[char] < t_dic[char]:
                    formed -= 1
                l += 1
            r += 1

        return '' if min_len == float('inf') else s[ranges[0]: ranges[1]+1]
```
