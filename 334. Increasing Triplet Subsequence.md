### Solutions

Idea:
- First, find a smallest #; \
  then, find a 2nd smallest #; \
  finally, find any # larger than both of them.
- What if new smallest or 2nd-smallest # occurs after finding a valid pair? like `[1,2,0,3]`:\
  Since we confirm a valid `smallest & 2nd-smallest`, any other new upcoming will only cause update of smallest or 2nd-smallest,
  but the relationship has already be confirmed. So whenever we find a larger #, return True (it means we ignore the update
  and we values the confirmed relationship only).
- example like `[2,1,0,3]` will cause updates before relationship confirms. So the rationale also works.

```python
class Solution:
    def increasingTriplet(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        smallest = float('inf')
        smallest_2nd = float('inf')

        for num in nums:
            if num <= smallest:
                smallest = num
            elif num <= smallest_2nd:
                smallest_2nd = num
            else:
                return True

        return False
```
