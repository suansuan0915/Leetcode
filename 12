### Notes

**Prefix Sum**

If we want products of an array except number at index i, and we cannot use division, then consider prefix sum:\
the product at index i = product of all numbers of i's left side * product of all numbers of i's right side.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  use extra space to keep products of Left side and products of Right side.\
  initiate arrays of same length with 0 as initial values (easy for later fill-in).\
  TC: O(n), SC: O(n)
```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        L, R, ans = [0]*n, [0]*n, [0]*n

        L[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            L[i] = L[i-1] * nums[i-1]

        R[n-1] = 1
        for i in range(-2, -n-1, -1):
            if i == -1:
                R[-1] = 1
            R[i] = R[i+1] * nums[i+1]

        for i in range(n):
            ans[i] = L[i] * R[i]

        return ans
```
