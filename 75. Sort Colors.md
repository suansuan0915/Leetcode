# [75. Sort Colors]()

Medium

### Solution
Sort (no fuction):\
**Dutch National Flag Problem, proposed by Edsger W. Dijkstra**

Idea:
- Hold two boundaries for 3 colors: rightmost of `p0`, leftmost of `p2`.
- `curr` need to traverse and evaluate all # left to p2 (right of p2 doesn't need to be evaluated, becoz they're already 2 on the right locations)
  - Whenever swap curr=2 w/ the number at p2, that number is yet to be handled (so `curr` stays same location for next turn evaluation, don't move curr).
  - don't need to handle the # after swap w/ p0 (becoz p0 won't be right of any 1 or 2, since it starts from idx=0 and only move whenever 0 occurs).
    (so we can move `curr`)
  - when curr=1, just move curr. nothing can be done.
- left of p0 & right of p2:\
  both guarantee to be 0 and 2.
  
TC: O(n), SC: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        curr = 0
        p0, p2 = 0, len(nums)-1

        while curr <= p2:
            if nums[curr] == 2:
                nums[p2], nums[curr] = nums[curr], nums[p2]
                p2 -= 1
            elif nums[curr] == 0:
                nums[p0], nums[curr] = nums[curr], nums[p0]
                p0 += 1
                curr += 1
            elif nums[curr] == 1:
                curr += 1
```
