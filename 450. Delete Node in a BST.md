# [450. Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

Medium

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  iteration.

  Idea:
  - 3 conditions (the deleted node has 1-child, no-child, 2-children).
    
  Note:
  - In a BST, when deleting a node with two children:
    the convention is to replace it with in-order successor (deleted_node.right), NOT predecessor.

  Edge cases:
  - when no key exists in tree: which means `curr` reaches None node finally. now return unchanged tree.
  - In 1-child or no-child condition: check "parent" first.
  - In 2-child condition: successor can have NO left child or left child.

  TC: O(n), SC: O(1)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], key: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        parent = None
        curr = root

        while curr and curr.val != key:
            parent = curr
            if key < curr.val:
                curr = curr.left
            elif key > curr.val:
                curr = curr.right

        # if no key exists (means now curr reaches None node)
        # check "curr"
        if curr is None:
            return root

        ## 1. the node has 1 child or no child
        # if (curr.left and not curr.right) or (curr.right and not curr.left): 
            # t/f or f/t
        # if not curr.left and not curr.right: 
            #f/f

        if not (curr.left and curr.right):
            child = curr.left if curr.left else curr.right

            # check "parent" (now root is deleted)
            if parent is None:
                return child

            if curr == parent.left:
                parent.left = child
            elif curr == parent.right:
                parent.right = child
        
        ## 2. the node has 2 children
        else:
            successor = curr.right
            successor_parent = curr
            while successor.left:
                successor_parent = successor
                successor = successor.left
            curr.val = successor.val
            # now, successor can have either left child OR no left child
            if successor_parent.left == successor:
                successor_parent.left = successor.right
            elif successor_parent.right == successor:
                successor_parent.right = successor.right

        return root
