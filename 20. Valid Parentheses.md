# [20. Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/)

Easy

### Notes
Why choose **stack**:\
the *last* one p should be the *first* to close. (like in `({[[ ]]})`, the second `[` is the 1st one to close).\
Stack: LIFO.

\+ hash table

In this way, we can loop through s from left to right in one pass, and compare.

### Edge Cases

- `[](`\
  after go through `[]`, `(` pushed to stack.\
  -> no p left in s, while stack still have a p, cannot return true directly now. Need to check `len(stack)==0`.
  
- `[])`\
  after go through `[]`, no p in stack, cannot pop from empty list and then compare.\
  -> add a constraint to check `len(stack)==0` 

### Solutions
- Method 1:\
since we have a heads.pop() in if statement, heads will pop out tail number always (whatever the if statement meets or not). \
So we don't have to pop heads again in a following else statement, AND we must place `len(heads)==0` check before `i!=pairs[heads.pop()]` check (otherwise heads already changed, result can be wrong! example: "[ ]")\
TC: O(n)\
SC: O(n)
```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        if not s:
            return False
        
        stack = []
        parentheses = {
            '(': ')',
            '{': '}',
            '[': ']'
        }

        for p in s:
            if p in parentheses:
                stack.append(p)
            elif len(stack) == 0 or p != parentheses[stack.pop()]:
                return False
        
        return len(stack) == 0
```

- Method 2:\
  Preferred!\
  store & check in one pass: store 1st-half parenthesis, check if correspondant when meet 2nd-half.
```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # stack structure
        parenthesis = \
            {')': '('
            , '}': '{'
            , ']': '['}
        stacks = []

        for char in s:
            if char in ['(', '{', '[']:
                stacks.append(char)
            else:
                if stacks:
                    stack_char = stacks.pop()
                    if parenthesis[char] != stack_char:
                        return False
                else:
                    return False
        
        return False if stacks else True
```
