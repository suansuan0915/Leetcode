# 217. Contains Duplicate - Easy

[Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

- method 1:\
hash table.

```python

class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        # hash table
        # TC, SC: O(n)
        h = dict()
        for i in nums:
            if i in h:
                return True
            h[i] = 1
        return False

```

## Note

For certain test cases with not very large nn, the runtime of this method can be slower than Approach #2. The reason is hash table has some overhead in maintaining its property. One should keep in mind that real world performance can be different from what the Big-O notation says. The Big-O notation only tells us that for sufficiently large input, one will be faster than the other. Therefore, when nn is not sufficiently large, an O(n)O(n) algorithm can be slower than an O(n \log n)O(nlogn) algorithm.


- method 2:\
Sorting.\
TC: O(nlgn)\
SC: O(1)
```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if nums[i] == nums[i+1]:
                return True
        return False
```
