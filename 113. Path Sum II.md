### Solutions

DFS

because this problem requires lists as answer (while #112 asks only True/False as answer), if using BFS, the memory can be quite heavy.

Idea:
-

WRONG:
```
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        paths = []

        self.dfs(root, targetSum, [], paths)
        return paths

    def dfs(self, root, targetSum, path, paths):
        if not root:
            return 

        targetSum -= root.val
        path.append(root.val)

        if not root.left and not root.right:
            if targetSum == 0:
                paths.append(path)  ## WRONG!
            path = []  ## WRONG!
            return
        
        self.dfs(root.left, targetSum, path, paths)
        self.dfs(root.right, targetSum, path, paths)

```

Note:
- Why append "copying path" (as `list(path)`) but NOT "path":

  copy the list (using `list(path)` or similar) when storing results, ensuring that each path is independent.
- Why WRONG `path = []`:
  - becoz list `path` is mutable, and reassign path to `[]` after reaching a leave
  won't affect `path` in other call creates a new local list: \
  this only changes `path` locally in the current recursive call, but does not affect the original path in the parent recursive calls.\
  - However, change it **in-place** will affect it globally: \
    `.append()`, `.pop()`.
  - (example: `[1,2,3]`, when finish node 2, update path will incorrectly update path=[1] in `dfs(node3)`, too)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        paths = []

        self.dfs(root, targetSum, [], paths)
        return paths

    def dfs(self, root, targetSum, path, paths):
        if not root:
            return 

        targetSum -= root.val
        path.append(root.val)

        if not root.left and not root.right:
            if targetSum == 0:
                paths.append(list(path))
        
        self.dfs(root.left, targetSum, path, paths)
        self.dfs(root.right, targetSum, path, paths)

        path.pop()
```
