# [57. Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Medium

### Notes

- `list.append()` returns None.\
  So need to return the exact list as final result. Otherwise will get None instead of the list value.
- Why when overlap exists, merge interval and newInterval into a newInterval?:\
  becoz `intervals` are given non-overlapping intervals, our task is to add a newInterval and make them a new non-overlapping interval.\
  Therefore, the intervals which have overlaps with given newInterval should be union to a new interval. This unioned interval should be separate with others non-overlapped intervals,
  like the first two conditions discussed.
- Three conditions:
  - [........], newInterval, intervals[i:]
  - [........], interval[i], [.....], newInterval, ..........
  - If overlap, create a newinterval, then keep merge newinterval w/ sticky intervals to update newinterval until it's independent with other intervals, finally append.
 
- In the process, any interval in `intervals` is independent and has no sticky relationship to neither previous or following interval.\
  Also, if newInterval's tail > interval's head, feel free to append interval to ans, becoz it is independent w/ previous interval.\
  if newInterval's tail < interval's head, feel free to append newInterval to ans, becoz if newInterval is sticky to prev interval, this situation should have been dealed with in previous turn.\
  ------> Therefore, 3 conditions here.
    
### Solutions

- Method:\
  Interval.\
  TC: O(n)\
  SC: O(1)
```python
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []

        for i in range(len(intervals)):
            if newInterval[1] < intervals[i][0]:
                res.append(newInterval)
                return res + intervals[i:]
            elif intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]:
                res.append(intervals[i])
            else:
                newInterval = [
                    min(intervals[i][0], newInterval[0]),
                    max(intervals[i][1], newInterval[1])
                ]

        res.append(newInterval)
        return res
```
