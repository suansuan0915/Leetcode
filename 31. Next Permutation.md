### Solutions

*" next larger permutation "*: \
the smallest permutation larger than this one.\
Example: for `[1,5,4,2]`, next larger permutation is [2, 1,4,5].

Therefore, only non-descending order permutation has the next larger permutation. e.g.: [5,4,2,1] has no. So we reverse it to smallest permutation as the answer.

Idea:
- Find the breakpoint where nums[i] start to smaller than nums[i+1] (so we should search from right to left).
- If breakpoint:
  - Then find the next larger number larger than nums[i] from i's right side. (here, i's right side will naturally be descending regarding step 1. So whenever we find nums[j]>nums[i],
  it is the number we want).
  - Swap nums[i] and nums[j].
- Reverse i's right side (which is descending, convert them to ascending, so the final answer is "next larger permutation")

class Solution:
    def nextPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        i = len(nums)-2
        
        # 1. find the breakpoint
        while i >= 0 and nums[i] >= nums[i+1]:
                i -= 1

        # 2. If breakpoint exists: find the number on the right of i, which is next larger than nums[i]
        if i >= 0:
            j = len(nums) - 1
            while nums[j] <= nums[i]:
                j -= 1

            # 3. swap i and j
            self.swap(i, j, nums) # or: nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
    
        # 4. reverse the part right of breakpoint
        nums[i+1:] = reversed(nums[i+1:])

    def swap(self, i, j, nums):
        temp = nums[i]
        nums[i] = nums[j]
        nums[j] = temp
