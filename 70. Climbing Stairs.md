# [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/)

Easy

### Notes

**Dynamic programming**

Nth method = (n-1) methods + (n-2) methods, similar to Fibonacci series.

example: n=2 has 2 methods, n=3 has 3 methods.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  DP.\
  TC, SC: O(n)
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 1

        dp = [0] * (n+1)
        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1

        for i in range(2, n+1):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

        return dp[n]
```

- Method 2:\
  DP. Same as method 1, but save space with a variable to keep track of Nth element.\
  TC: O(n), SC: O(1)
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 1
            
        prev, curr = 1, 1

        for i in range(2, n+1):
            prev_copy = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = prev_copy + curr
        
        return curr
```
