# [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/)

Easy

### Notes

**Dynamic programming**

Nth method = (n-1) methods + (n-2) methods, similar to Fibonacci series.

example: n=2 has 2 methods, n=3 has 3 methods.

### Solutions

- Method 1:
  
TLE - Fibonacci - recursive method:\
TC: O(2**n)
```
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        if n == 2:
            return 2

        return self.climbStairs(n-1) + self.climbStairs(n-2)
```

Instead, using iterative method:\
similar methods as DP, but save SC.

TC: O(n), SC: O(1).

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        ### Method 1:
        # Fibonacci - iteration
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        if n == 2:
            return 2
            
        first = 1
        second = 2
        ans_n = 0 

        for i in range(3, n+1):
            ans_n = first + second
            first = second
            second = ans_n

        return ans_n
            
```

- Method 2:\
  DP.\
  Similar method as Fibonacci iteration.
  
  Note:
  - beginning base case `if` statement is necessary, becoz otherwise when n==1, dp initialized to have only 2 elements, dp[2] will raise out-of-range error.
    
  TC, SC: O(n)
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 1

        dp = [0] * (n+1)
        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1

        for i in range(2, n+1):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

        return dp[n]
```

- Method 3:\
  DP. Same as method 1, but save space with a variable to keep track of Nth element.\
  TC: O(n), SC: O(1)
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 1
            
        prev, curr = 1, 1

        for i in range(2, n+1):
            prev_copy = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = prev_copy + curr
        
        return curr
```
