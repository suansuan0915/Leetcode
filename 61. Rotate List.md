# [61. Rotate List](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Medium

### Problems
**In a Linkedlist, change the order of nodes, by:**
- by certain condition (value of the nodes): #86
- by rotation of k nodes: #61

### Note
- How to count node number, while point old tail to old head at the same time.

### Solution
- Idea:\
  First get "real" k, then point old tail to old head, and point (n-k)th node to None as new tail. Finally return new head.
- Edge case:\
  none nodes, or only 1 node.
- TC: O(n), SC: O(1)
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return None
        if not head.next:
            return head

        n = 1
        old_tail = head

        while old_tail.next:
            old_tail = old_tail.next 
            n += 1
        old_tail.next = head
        ## WRONG: this cannot successfully point old tail to old head, since we get to null node as current node after finishing while loop. 
        # while old_tail:
        #     old_tail = old_tail.next
        #     n += 1
        # old_tail = head

        k %= n
        new_tail = head

        for i in range(n-k-1):
            new_tail = new_tail.next
        new_head = new_tail.next
        new_tail.next = None

        return new_head
```
