## 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

:alarm_clock: Feb 2

### LinkedList + Two Pointers

- method 1:\
walks m, taking down nodes (SC: O(m)); then walks n, checking which node appears in previous taken-down nodes (TC: O(m+n))

- method 2 - Optimal:\
SC: O(1), no need to take down nodes

how to get two pointers p1, p2 meet at any node?\
-> connect two linkedlists to one\
each pointer walks their own list, then walks another list

Explanation in graph:\

In other words to explain why in this way two pointers must meet:\
`(m-k) + k + (n-k) + k`\
`(n-k) + k + (m-k) + k`\
first 3 add together is (m+n-k) for both p1 and p2, since total length each pointer walk is both (m+n), this means they have k remaining at last steps,\
which indicating p1 and p2 must meet at this kth node from end.
