## 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

:alarm_clock: Feb 2

### LinkedList + Two Pointers

- method 1:\
walks m, taking down nodes (SC: O(m)); then walks n, checking which node appears in previous taken-down nodes (TC: O(m+n))

- method 2 - Optimal:\
SC: O(1), no need to take down nodes

how to get two pointers p1, p2 meet at any node?\
-> connect two linkedlists to one\
each pointer walks their own list, then walks another list

Explanation in graph:\

In other words to explain why in this way two pointers must meet:\
For p1: `(m-k) + k + (n-k) + k`\
For p2: `(n-k) + k + (m-k) + k`\
first 3 add together is (m+n-k) for both p1 and p2, since total length each pointer walk is both (m+n), this means they have k remaining at last steps,
which indicating p1 and p2 must meet at this kth node from end.

This covers the condition of no intersection:\
means node meets is null node. (both p1, p2 are null, so they equal)

#### Code:
```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        ## Method 1:
        # Linkedlist + Two Pointers
        # TC: O(m+n), SC: O(1)
        p1 = headA
        p2 = headB

        while p1 != p2:
            if not p1:
                p1 = headB
            else:
                p1 = p1.next
            if not p2:
                p2 = headA
            else:
                p2 = p2.next
        return p1 

```
