## 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

### Two Pointers + Linkedlist

Similar Q w/ **Q26 Delete Duplicates in Array**

How to deal with the end of linkedlist:\
slow points to null node (`None` in python)

What to do with remaining nodes?\
Java/Python has implementation to figure out and recycle the memory of the remaining hanging nodes automatically. But not the case with languages like C++, 
programmers need to manually delete the nodes.

#### Code:
```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        ## Method:
        # Two Pointers + Linkedlist
        # TC: O(N), SC: O(1)
        if not head:
            return 

        i, j = head, head
        while j:
            if i.val != j.val:
                i.next = j   
                i = i.next         
            j = j.next
        i.next = None
        return head

```
