# [841. Keys and Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

Medium

### Solution

Binary tree.

Idea:
- key in one room can connect to another room. This means through each key in room, we can visit room-by-room, finally all rooms are labeled as "seen".

`all(iterable)`:\
returns True if all elements in the iterable are truthy (or if the iterable is empty).

Note:
- check if `seen[i]` is False before deciding to add node to `q`, otherwise will visit seen nodes.

`n`: # of rooms.   `e`: # of keys.
TC: O(n+e), SC: O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        seen = [False] * len(rooms)
        seen[0] = True
        q = [0]

        while q:
            # for _ in range(len(q)):
            curr_key = q.pop()
            for i in rooms[curr_key]:
                if not seen[i]:
                    seen[i] = True
                    q.append(i)

        return all(seen)
```
