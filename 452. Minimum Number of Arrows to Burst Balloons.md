### Solutions

**Interval**

Here, instead of find intervals, we need to find separate interval counts and overlapping area counts.

- Method 1:\
  Find the overlapping areas (store in a list for comparison), which is the minimum count of bursting balloons.
  TC: O(nlgn)\
  SC: O(n)
```python
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        merged = []

        for interval in points:
            if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
                merged.append(interval)
            else:
                merged[-1][0] = min(interval[0], merged[-1][0])
                merged[-1][1] = min(interval[1], merged[-1][1])

        
        return len(merged)
```

- Method 2:\
  Find the overlapping areas (but not store them), which is the minimum count of bursting balloons.
  TC: O(nlgn)\
  SC: O(1)
```python

```
