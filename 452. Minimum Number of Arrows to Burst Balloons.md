### Solutions

**Interval**

Here, instead of find intervals, we need to find overlapping area counts.

Why in details: if hit 2 baloons with 1 burst, the burst can reach as far as former baloon's x_end. So we keep the overlap area in ans when overlap happens. Next time, if the 3rd baloon overlaps, we compare it w/ prev overlapping area, to see if the previous burst cannot hit it. If it need extra burst. So similarly, do as what we did to previous two overlapped balloon. This is why we keep track of independent balloons and overlapping area in two overlapped for record count.

In normal interval Q, we separate 3 conditions, but here, we only need 2 conditions: non-overlapped, overlapped (no matter which overlapping type, just keep track of AND compare new balloon w/ the overlapping area for burst.

- Method:\
  Find the overlapping areas (store in a list for comparison), which is the minimum count of bursting balloons.\
  TC: O(nlgn)\
  SC: O(n) - `list.sort()` in-place still needs temporary memory.

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        prev = points[0]
        ans = 1

        for i in range(1, len(points)):
            if points[i][0] > prev[1]:
                ans += 1
                prev = points[i]
            else:
                prev = [max(points[i][0], prev[0]), min(points[i][1], prev[1])]

        return ans
```
