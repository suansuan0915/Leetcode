### Solutions

Find the minimum speed that Koko can eat up all numbers in h hours.\
-> For any pile, time spent: `math.ceil(piles[i] / speed)`.

- Method 1:\
  Brute force:\
  Start from speed=1, to check if Koko can finish all bananas in h hours.
  
  TC: O(mn) - Time Limit Exceeded, SC: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        speed = 1

        while speed:
            hours = 0
            for i in range(len(piles)):
                hours += math.ceil(piles[i] / speed)
            if hours <= h:
                return speed
            speed += 1
```

- Method 2:\
  Binary search:\
  we want to find min speed to complete all bananas.\
  -> Therefore, min_speed should be 1 (**!Note!** NOT 0 as usual BS!)\
  Since Koko won't eat more than piles[i] any hour if his speed >piles[i]\
  -> Max_speed should be max(piles).\
  ---> Problem becomes find minimum speed in this range to meet `h` or less time requirement.

  TC: O(nlgm) - n: length of array; m: length of speed range. SC: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        max_speed = max(piles)
        l, r = 1, max_speed

        while l <= r:
            mid_speed = l + (r - l) // 2
            hours = 0
            for pile in piles:
                hours += math.ceil(pile / mid_speed)
            if hours > h:
                l = mid_speed + 1
            else:
                r = mid_speed - 1

        return l
```
