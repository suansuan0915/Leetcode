### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  Prefix sum.

  Idea:\
  Count by all cells acting as the bottom-right corner of a square.
  - first, get the part of answer of row 1 and column 1 (mind no overlap at matrix[0][0]). 
  - second, traverse other cells, make each cell as the bottom-right corner of a square, the count at each cell = 1 (itself) + min(up, left, diagonal-left).

  TC: O(m*n), SC: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def countSquares(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        ans = 0

        for i in range(m):
            ans += matrix[i][0]

        for j in range(1, n):
            ans += matrix[0][j]

        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 1:
                    matrix[i][j] = 1 + min( \
                        matrix[i-1][j], \
                        matrix[i][j-1], \
                        matrix[i-1][j-1] \
                    )
                    ans += matrix[i][j]

        return ans
```
