# [530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Easy

**Binary Search Tree (BST) VS. Binary Tree**
- Binary Tree:\
  Have at most left, right children nodes.\
  Elements stored at NO specific order.
- BST:\
  Have at most left, right children nodes.\
  Nodes stored *in order*: left < parent < right.

⚠️ \
- `if node:`\
  if node value is *0 or None*, it can be evaluted to False.
- `if node is not None`\
  only null node is evaluated to False.
  
### Solutions
- Method 1:
  - DFS + sort the list:\
    To find min_difference, it can only be the difference between two neighbors in a sorted node list.\
    By *in-order traversal* (l->p->r) recursively, we can have a sorted list of nodes.
  - Note: to find min_diff, we cannot only compare parent&left and parent&right, becoz for parent nodes on different levels, we don't know which parent is larger
  (like parent1 has left1 and right1, left as a parent2 has left2 and right2. r2 > p1 > l1(p2), r2 > p2(l1) > l2 => cannot decide p1 and r2 which is larger.
  - TC: O(n), SC: O(n).

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def getMinimumDifference(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        ## Method 1:
        # DFS + sorted list
        nodes = []
        self.searchNodes(nodes, root)
        ans = float('inf')

        for i in range(len(nodes)-1):
            ans = min(ans, abs(nodes[i+1] - nodes[i]))

        return ans

    def searchNodes(self, nodes, root):
        if not root:
            return

        self.searchNodes(nodes, root.left)
        nodes.append(root.val)
        self.searchNodes(nodes, root.right)
```

- Method 2:
  - DFS w/o list:\
    Since we only need to calculate each pair of neighbors' difference, we only need to keep track of `prev_node` to get difference w/o a list.
  - Note: when node value is 0.
  - TC: O(n), SC: O(n) - we don't need to spend space on list, but recursion will need space to store the stack, which is O(n) in worst case and O(lgn) for a balanced tree.
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def getMinimumDifference(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        ## Method 2:
        # DFS w/o list
        self.prev = None
        self.ans = float('inf')

        def searchNodes(root):
            if root is None:
                return

            searchNodes(root.left)
            if self.prev is not None:
                self.ans = min(self.ans, abs(root.val - self.prev))
            self.prev = root.val
            searchNodes(root.right)

        searchNodes(root)
        return self.ans
```
