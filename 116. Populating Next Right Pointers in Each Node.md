## 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

:alarm_clock: Feb 23

### Method 1: Binary Tree - Traversal

If vanilla traversal() is used, we can only connect the two nodes in each subtree, but ignore the connection between right node 
and left node of two neighbor subtrees.

Therefore, think of connection as a **Trinary Tree** for left,right nodes of a root:

**Vanilla Traversal of Binary Tree**:
```python

def traversal(root: Optional[Node]):
    if not root:
       return
    
    # can add something else to deal w/ the two nodes
    traversal(root.left)
    traversal(root.right)

```

Space Complexity:\
SC: O(1) - If we don't make use of any additional *data structure* for traversing nodes on a particular level like the previous approach does.

#### Code:
```python

"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, left: 'Node' = None, right: 'Node' = None, next: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.next = next
"""

class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        ## Method 1:
        # Binary Tree - Traversal
        # TC: O(N) - process each node exactly once. 
        # SC: O(1) - we don't make use of any additional data structure for traversing nodes on a particular level like the previous approach does.
        def traverse(node1: Optional[Node], node2: Optional[Node]):
            if not node1 or not node2:
                return
            node1.next = node2
            traverse(node1.left, node1.right)
            traverse(node2.left, node2.right)
            traverse(node1.right, node2.left)
        
        if not root:
            return
        traverse(root.left, root.right)
        return root

```
