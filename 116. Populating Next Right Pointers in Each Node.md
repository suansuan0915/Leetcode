## 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

:alarm_clock: Feb 23

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  BFS.\
  We need to connect left and right subtrees. \
  So think of get all nodes in the same level and then connect them one-by-one.\
  TC: O(n), SC: O(n) <- two extra data structure for storage.
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, left: 'Node' = None, right: 'Node' = None, next: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.next = next
"""

class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if not root:
            return None
        
        q = collections.deque([root])
        temp = []

        while q:
            if temp:
                for i in range(len(temp)-1):
                    temp[i].next = temp[i+1]
                temp = []

            for _ in range(len(q)):
                curr = q.popleft()
                if curr:
                    temp.append(curr)
                    q.append(curr.left)
                    q.append(curr.right)

        return root
```

OR:\
More space efficient.\
TC: O(n), SC: O(n) <- only one extra data struture.\
Note: \
for this method, no null value should be stored in q (becoz we connect curr to q[0] in for loop over q).\
Also, len(q) should be stored as a fixed variable before any changes like `q.popleft()`.
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, left: 'Node' = None, right: 'Node' = None, next: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.next = next
"""

class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if not root:
            return None
        
        q = collections.deque([root])

        while q:
            size = len(q)
            for i in range(size):
                curr = q.popleft()
                if i < size - 1:
                    curr.next = q[0]
                if curr.left:
                    q.append(curr.left)
                if curr.right:
                    q.append(curr.right)

        return root
```

- Method 2:\
  BFS.\
  Idea:
  - Since full binary tree: While next level has a leftmost node, there's always next level to deal with. Otherwise, stop and return.\
    Use leftmost.left as while loop.
  - because we have next pointer on the current level (which is denoted in previous level turn), we move through current level by "next" pointer.
  - Two kinds of connection to make: l, r nodes of same parent; r node of left subtree and l node of right subtree.
    
  TC: O(n), SC: O(1)
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, left: 'Node' = None, right: 'Node' = None, next: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.next = next
"""

class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if not root:
            return None
        
        leftmost = root

        while leftmost.left:
            head = leftmost
            while head:
                head.left.next = head.right
                if head.next:
                    head.right.next = head.next.left
                head = head.next
            leftmost = leftmost.left
        
        return root
```

- Method 3: \
  Binary Tree - Traversal

If vanilla traversal() is used, we can only connect the two nodes in each subtree, but ignore the connection between right node 
and left node of two neighbor subtrees.

Therefore, think of connection as a **Trinary Tree** for left,right nodes of a root:

**Vanilla Traversal of Binary Tree**:
```python

def traversal(root: Optional[Node]):
    if not root:
       return
    
    # can add something else to deal w/ the two nodes
    traversal(root.left)
    traversal(root.right)

```

Space Complexity:\
SC: O(1) - If we don't make use of any additional *data structure* for traversing nodes on a particular level like the previous approach does.

```python

"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, left: 'Node' = None, right: 'Node' = None, next: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.next = next
"""

class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        ## Method 1:
        # Binary Tree - Traversal
        # TC: O(N) - process each node exactly once. 
        # SC: O(1) - we don't make use of any additional data structure for traversing nodes on a particular level like the previous approach does.
        def traverse(node1: Optional[Node], node2: Optional[Node]):
            if not node1 or not node2:
                return
            node1.next = node2
            traverse(node1.left, node1.right)
            traverse(node2.left, node2.right)
            traverse(node1.right, node2.left)
        
        if not root:
            return
        traverse(root.left, root.right)
        return root

```

### Decompose Method
not ideal here, since no returned values of subtrees are necessary
