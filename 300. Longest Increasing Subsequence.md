## DP
When to use DP:
- Base case exists and is known to be a constant.
- Following cases depends on previously made decisions.

### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  DP.

  Idea:
  - For 1st idx (and also for each idx): always only 1 element in increasing sequence.
  - The following longest sequence is based on previous.
  - We will decide if a number is worth using or not in the sequence.
  - Note: why use `max()` to get `memo[i]`: memo[i] equals to max(prev_j)+1.

  TC: O(n**2), SC: O(n)
 
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ### Method 1:
        ## DP
        memo = [1] * len(nums)

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    memo[i] = max(memo[i], memo[j] + 1) # why max: memo[i] uses max(prev_j)+1.

        return max(memo)
```


- Method 2:\
  Build the subsequence.

  Idea:
  - `seq` is the sequence we want (it's always increasing).
  - if nums[i] > max(seq), which is seq[-1], then append to seq.
  - elif nums[i] <= max(seq):
    - find the 1st larger than nums[i] number in `seq` and replace it w/ nums[i].
      - Why?: this can allows for more possibility for other increasing sequence when we meet a smaller #.
   
  TC: O(n**2), SC: O(n)
  
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        seq = []

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if not seq or nums[i] > seq[-1]:
                seq.append(nums[i])
            else:
                for j in range(i):
                    if seq[j] >= nums[i]:
                        seq[j] = nums[i]
                        break

        return len(seq)
```


- Method 3:\
  Binary Search.

  Idea: optimize Method 2 w/ binary search.

  Edge Case: \
  `[4,10,4,3,8,9]`
  - if a smaller number is the same as a number in seq, replace it with itself.

  TC: O(nlgn), SC: O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        seq = [nums[0]]

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > seq[-1]:
                seq.append(nums[i])
            else:
                l, r = 0, len(seq) - 1
                while l < r:
                    mid = l + (r - l) // 2
                    if seq[mid] >= nums[i]:
                        r = mid
                    else:
                        l = mid + 1
                seq[r] = nums[i]
            
        return len(seq)
```
