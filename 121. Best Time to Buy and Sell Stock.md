# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Solutions:
- method 1: \
brute force\
TC: O(n ** 2) - However, time limit exceeded here.\
SC: O(1)

```python

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(prices)):
                # if prices[j] > prices[i] and (prices[j] - prices[i]) > max_profit:
                #     max_profit = prices[j] - prices[i]  # or profit still previous max_profit
                max_profit = max(prices[j] - prices[i], max_profit)
        return max_profit

```

- method 2:\
find min price on left side, max price on right side.\
if there's an increasing trend between any two numbers, there's max profit; if none, profit is 0 (default value we set).

TC: O(n)\
SC: O(1)
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_i, max_i = 0, 1
        profit = 0

        while max_i <= len(prices)-1:
            if prices[min_i] > prices[max_i]:
                min_i = max_i
                max_i += 1
            else:   
                profit = max(profit, prices[max_i]-prices[min_i])
                max_i += 1
        
        return profit
```

OR:

find min price in previous period, then get profit.\
10-float('-inf') equals inf, not number itself.
```python

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        min_price = float('inf')
        for p in prices:
            max_profit = max(max_profit, p-min_price)
            min_price = min(p, min_price)
        return max_profit
```

OR:\
Idea: keep track of min_buy until current index, then calculate max_profit dynamically.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = prices[0]
        max_profit = 0

        for p in prices:
            min_price = min(min_price, p)
            max_profit = max(max_profit, p - min_price)

        return max_profit
```

OR:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        buy = prices[0]

        for i in range(len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > buy:
                max_profit = max(prices[i] - buy, max_profit)
            if prices[i] < buy:
                buy = prices[i]

        return max_profit
```
