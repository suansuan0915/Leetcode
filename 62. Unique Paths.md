### Solutions

- Method 1:\
  DP - brute force (TLE)
  
  Idea:
  - why use DP, not BFS Matrix?
    - becoz BFS will pop cell once but we may need a cell multiple times to explore all possible paths.
  - this problem can be view as: the exit cell can be reached from left or up, then for left and up cells respectively, cell can be reached from ....\ 
       ----> f(m, n-1) + f(m-1, n)
  - Cells in row 0 and col 0 only have 1 path.

  TC: O(2**(m+n)) - TLE, recursion tree has (m+n) depth, each cell/step produces 2 recursion calls. That is `1+2^1+2^2+2^3+....+2^(m+n)` \
  SC: O(mn)

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        if m == 1 or n == 1:
            return 1

        return self.uniquePaths(m, n-1) + self.uniquePaths(m-1, n)
```


- Method 2:\
  DP - memoization table

  Idea: \
  bryte force is TLE becoz it calculate duplicates. Memoization table stores all values computed so far, so save TC.

  TC: O(mn), SC: O(mn)

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        memo = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)]
        
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                memo[i][j] = memo[i][j-1] + memo[i-1][j]

        return memo[m-1][n-1]
```
